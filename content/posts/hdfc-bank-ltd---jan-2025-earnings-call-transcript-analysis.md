### Key Metrics

*   AUM Advances Growth: 8% YoY.
*   Cost Growth: 7% YoY.
*   Net Interest Margins (NIMs): "reasonably range-bound and stable despite the headwinds from tight liquidity". Started at 3.4% post-merger and remained in a "stable band".
*   Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR): 68% overall; 71% excluding seasonal agri impact (flat QoQ ex-agri).
*   Cost-to-Income Ratio: Stable around 40.5% ("between 40%, 41%").

*   Slippages: "Excluding the seasonal agri, the slippages are flat period-to-period."
*   HDB Financial Services Credit Costs: Increased Q-o-Q from 1.8% to 2.5%, driven by higher Stage 3 provisions, including management overlays due to economic forecast changes. Stage 2 improved QoQ.

### Comparisons

*   Deposit growth (15% avg) is outpacing loan growth (8% AUM YoY), aiding CD ratio normalization.
*   Cost growth (7% YoY) is contained relative to branch expansion (1000+) and inflation (5-6%).
*   NIM stability achieved despite higher funding costs (TDs replacing CASA) offsetting gains from reduced borrowing costs. CFO: "good amount of the tailwind that has come to reduce the borrowing cost... has been offset by the CASA".
*   PCR (68%) lower than some peers, explained by portfolio mix (higher retail/unsecured, faster write-offs) and NPA vintage. CFO: "it depends on the mix of products, secured, unsecured that come in and go out."

### Guidance/Forecasts

*   No new explicit numerical guidance provided. Management reiterated previous loan growth outlook relative to the system: FY25 < system, FY26 = system, FY27 > system. CEO: "whatever we had committed... that is the kind of commitment that we continue to maintain. We are on track".

### Growth/Decline Areas

*   Strong growth in deposits, particularly time deposits (22.7% growth). Moderated loan growth, especially in Emerging Corporates (stable QoQ) due to pricing discipline. CASA ratio under pressure due to higher interest rates.

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

### Major Strategic Announcements

*   Primary focus remains on normalizing the Credit-Deposit (CD) ratio by growing deposits faster than loans. CEO: "progressing well in our journey to normalize our credit deposit ratio with the deposit growth outpacing our loan growth." Conscious calibration of loan growth via credit models and pricing discipline.

### New Products/Services/Markets

*   Focus on integrating HDFC Ltd.'s mortgage customers into the bank's full product suite. CFO: "getting the liability accounts opened, we are like 96%, 97% successful for any new to bank incremental mortgages... About 1.9 million of them [ex-HDFC Ltd customers] so far, we have been successful to bring them on the liability relationship."

### Operational Changes

*   Continued branch expansion (1,052 added in 12 months). Significant investment in technology (now >10% of costs). Tight cost management despite expansion. Active treasury management, including buying back INR 44 billion of bonds. Focus on employee productivity. Deliberate shedding of high-cost, low LCR value wholesale deposits from the HDFC Ltd book.

### Ongoing/Completed Projects

*   Merger integration is the key ongoing initiative, focusing on customer onboarding, cross-selling, and branch enablement (80%+ branches activated for mortgages). PSL compliance management involves organic growth, portfolio buyouts (IBPC/PTC), and PSLC purchases.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

*   Operating in a "very challenging macro environment, with tight liquidity conditions, signs of moderating urban demand, a tepid private capital expenditure programs...". Intense competition for deposits leading to a "tight pricing environment". Shift in deposit mix towards time deposits system-wide due to high interest rates. Spread compression observed in corporate and emerging corporate lending. CEO: "spreads are tightening". Some positive signs noted: rural demand pickup, government spending increase, strong services exports.

### Competitive Positioning

*   Gaining deposit market share ("continued to gain market share"). Maintaining a strong credit quality profile ("credit USP," "resilient and stable"). Lower RWA density (~67%) compared to peers. Lower overall loan yields than some peers, attributed to risk profile and mix. Best-in-class cost-to-assets ratio (~1.93%).

### Market Challenges/Opportunities

*   Tight liquidity and high deposit costs are major challenges impacting NIMs and CASA. Spread compression limits ability to pass on costs. PSL compliance, particularly for Small/Marginal Farmers (SMF) and weaker sections, remains a focus area ("percentage point or so that we do need to close on SMF and the weaker section"). Opportunity seen in rural demand and potential.
