#### Working Capital Trends

| Metric                   | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | Change |
| :----------------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :----- |
| Current Assets           | 49,722.33      | 41,765.69      | +19.05% |
| Current Liabilities      | 21,698.24     | 22,020.02      | -1.46%|

|Current Ratio|2.28|1.9|

##### Analysis:
Working capital has increased significantly, indicating improved short-term liquidity. Current ratio also improved in current year.

#### Asset Quality Metrics

| Metric                            | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Impairment Loss on Financial Assets| N/A           |N/A|
| Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)      | N/A           | N/A       |
|Net Fixed Asset turnover Ratio |10.23|8.52|

##### Analysis:
Bikaji, as a manufacturing and sales company, doesn't have traditional "loans" as assets, making NPA metrics irrelevant. The company does report trade receivables, and there is a very minor provision for Expected Credit Losses, the allowance is so small relative to the total receivables that it suggests excellent asset quality in this area.

#### Debt Structure and Maturity Profile

| Debt Type                      | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | Maturity          | Secured/Unsecured | Interest Rate (Range) |
| :----------------------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
| Term Loans (Non-Current)    | 1168.62          | 4241.36          | Varies             | Secured          | 8.02%-9.00% p.a.           |
| Loans Repayable on Demand (Current) |10374.65            | 9949.22| On Demand         | Secured/ Unsecured       | 7.80% to 11.00% p.a.|
| Current Maturities of long term debt|3342.89|2294.83|

##### Analysis:

*  The Group relies on a mix of long-term and short-term debt, with a significant portion being short-term loans repayable on demand.
*  A part of Long Term Borrowing has been reclassified into current borrowing, due to maturity.
* The Company has both secured and unsecured borrowing.
*The repayment terms on the term loans are on monthly/ quarterly/ half-yearly basis.

#### Off-Balance Sheet Items

| Item                            | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 |

| Corporate Guarantees Outstanding | 1,900.00     |1900.00 |

##### Analysis:
Contingent liabilities have increased, which warrants further investigation to understand the nature of these liabilities. Capital commitments are substantial, suggesting ongoing investment in fixed assets. The corporate guarantee provided to the subsidiary should be monitored, as well the status of revocation from Bank.

#### Working Capital Management Efficiency

We'll analyze the following ratios:

*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
*   **Receivables Turnover Ratio:** Net Sales / Average Trade Receivables
*   **Payables Turnover Ratio:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Trade Payables
*   Net operating cycle
    *   For FY2024: Inventory =2,664.87+8,229.26/2= 5,447.06 Recievables= 1,726.67+10,865.23/2= 6,295.95 Payables =1,563.26+4,989.13/2 =3,276.19
    *   For FY2023: Inventory = 2,091.92+7,033.55/2 =4,562.73 Recievables= 1,322.46+8,197.67/2=4,760.06 Payables = 1,117.54+5,501.79/2=3,309.66

| Ratio                      | FY 2023-24           | FY 2022-23 (Restated) |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Inventory Turnover Ratio     | 38.96                | 39.73                 |
| Receivables Turnover Ratio  | 35.49                | 41.30                 |
| Payables Turnover Ratio    | 66.85                | 56.54                 |
| Net Operating Cycle        | 55.57 days           | 60.35 days           |

**Key Observations:** The Inventory turnover ratio and Receivables turnover ratio has been slightly decreased.

#### CAPEX Analysis by Segment

The provided document does not offer a detailed breakdown of capital expenditures (CAPEX) by segment. It only mentions total amounts spent, as shown in the OCF, ICF, FCF section. The company mentioned that they are a single segment company so no segment break-down can be made.

#### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividend:** Bikaji paid a dividend of H 0.75 per share in FY23 and H 1.00 per share in FY24. Dividend has been increased.
*   **Share Buyback:** No new share buyback was done in FY23 and FY24.

#### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

DSCR = (Net Operating Income + Depreciation) / (Principal Repayment + Interest)

|                               | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Net Operating Income (EBIT) | 36,731.60 | 18,896.79 |
| Depreciation & Amortization   | 6,157.74 | 4,850.61 |
| Principal Repayment          | 2,447.57 | 1,542.43 |
| Interest Expense             | 1233.50 | 1,180.70 |
| **DSCR** | 16.25 | 14.59 |

**Key Observations:** Bikaji has a very healthy DSCR, indicating a strong ability to cover its debt obligations. The ratio has improved in FY24, showing growth in income.

#### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities

|                                   | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 (Restated) |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Current Assets                    | 49,941.36 | 41,831.15 |
| Current Liabilities               | 21,529.53 | 22,210.02 |
| **Current Ratio** | 2.32 | 1.88 |

The company has strong current ratio and also increased in FY24.

*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**
    *   CCC = Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) + Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) - Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)
    *   We've already calculated the turnover ratios. To get the "days" metrics, divide 365 by the turnover ratios:
        *   DIO = 365 / Inventory Turnover Ratio
        *   DSO = 365 / Receivables Turnover Ratio
        *   DPO = 365 / Payables Turnover Ratio
    *   Based on the calculated turnover ratio

| | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| DIO | 9.37 days | 9.19 days |
| DSO | 10.28 days | 8.84 days |
| DPO | 5.46 | 6.46 |
| **CCC (Days)** | 14.19 | 11.57 |

**Key Observations:** The Company has an overall very strong and efficient liquidity position and cash conversion cycle.

#### Free Cash Flow Yield Trends

*   Free Cash Flow Yield = Free Cash Flow / Market Capitalization
*   Market Capitalization is provided for March 31, 2024 as H 12,280 Crores. We would need market capitalization data for March 31, 2023 to complete this calculation.
*   FCF can be approximated as OCF - Capex. As per the cash flow statement the closest calculation is:

| | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| FCF (OCF-CAPEX) | 12,116.97 | 7,565.13 |

We cannot conclude on trends without historical market capitalization data for previous year.

### Summary and Overall Assessment

*   **Qualitative Factors:** This analysis is purely based on the financial data provided. A comprehensive assessment would also consider qualitative factors like market position, competition, regulatory environment, and management quality.

In conclusion, Bikaji Foods International Limited appears to be in a strong financial position, with solid profitability, good cash generation, and prudent financial management.
