## Crisil Limited - Financial Analysis Report 2024

### Executive Summary

Crisil Limited demonstrated resilience in 2024, achieving moderate consolidated revenue growth (3.6%) amidst a complex global environment. Profitability improved, with Profit Before Tax (PBT) rising to INR 926.47 crore and Profit After Tax (PAT) reaching INR 684.07 crore, although 2023 results included a significant one-off gain. Growth was primarily driven by the Ratings segment, capitalizing on healthy domestic bond issuances, while the Research, Analytics, and Solutions segment faced headwinds from curtailed discretionary spending by global financial clients. Strategic initiatives included a major brand transformation to position Crisil as a global analytics organization, continued investment in technology (notably GenAI), talent development, and sustainability integration (including obtaining an ESG Ratings Provider license). The company maintained a strong financial position, supported by an asset-light model and robust cash flows, allowing for a recommended increase in total dividend payout. Key risks revolve around macroeconomic uncertainty, cybersecurity, competitive intensity, talent retention, and the potential impact of GenAI disruption. The outlook remains cautiously optimistic, contingent on global economic stability and client spending patterns.

### Financial Performance Analysis

#### Consolidated Performance

*   **Revenue:** Total income from operations grew 3.6% year-over-year (YoY) to INR 3,349.42 crore from INR 3,233.16 crore in 2023.
*   **Profitability:** PBT increased to INR 926.47 crore from INR 867.70 crore (which included a one-off gain of INR 29.4 crore in 2023). PAT rose slightly to INR 684.07 crore from INR 658.44 crore.
*   **Margins:** Operating Profit Margin (EBITDA/Total Income) remained stable at 30%. Net Profit Margin also held steady at 20%.
*   **Expenses:** Total expenses increased moderately to INR 2,422.95 crore from INR 2,365.46 crore, primarily driven by increases in repairs & maintenance and professional fees. Employee benefit expenses constituted 53% of total income, slightly down from 54% in 2023.

#### Segment Performance

*   **Ratings Services:** Revenue grew a healthy 17.4% YoY, outperforming the other segment. This was driven by market leadership in corporate bonds (aided by strong second-half issuances and investor preference for quality) and continued analytical support to S&P Global via the Global Analytics Centre (GAC). Bank Loan Ratings (BLR) activity reflected slower overall bank credit growth.
*   **Research, Analytics and Solutions:** This segment experienced mixed results.
    *   *Crisil Intelligence* showed momentum, particularly in consulting (infra, government initiatives) and thematic research. Risk solutions (EWS) and Credit+ ICON saw good traction.
    *   *Crisil Integral IQ* faced headwinds due to curtailed discretionary spending by global financial clients, although buy-side offerings saw momentum and progress was made in leveraging GenAI.
    *   *Crisil Coalition Greenwich* benefited from momentum in Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) and large commercial banks, despite market uncertainties.

#### Geographic Performance

North America remained the largest revenue contributor (approx. 39%), followed by India (approx. 30%) and Europe (approx. 22%).

#### Key Ratios

*   Return on Net Worth (RoNW) moderated to 29% from 33%, potentially reflecting increased equity base or slower profit growth relative to equity.
*   Debtor Turnover Ratio improved slightly from 4.3x to 5.2x, indicating potentially faster collection of receivables.
*   Current Ratio remained healthy at 2.0x (vs. 2.1x prior year).

#### Standalone Performance

Standalone total income showed marginal growth to INR 2,165.58 crore. However, PBT declined to INR 705.42 crore from INR 763.38 crore, and PAT decreased to INR 615.88 crore from INR 668.26 crore, suggesting higher cost pressures or shifts in business mix within the standalone entity compared to the consolidated group. Dividend income from subsidiaries is a major component of standalone 'Other Income'.

#### Dividend & Capital

The Board recommended a final dividend of INR 26 per share. Combined with interim dividends, the total dividend for 2024 is INR 56 per share, up from INR 54 in 2023, reflecting confidence in performance and cash flows. Issued capital increased slightly due to the exercise of employee stock options (ESOS).

### Strategic & Operational Highlights

*   **Market Position & Brand:** Crisil reinforced its leadership, particularly in the Indian ratings market. The strategic brand transformation aims to unify business segments (Crisil Ratings, Crisil Intelligence, Crisil Coalition Greenwich, Crisil Integral IQ) under a cohesive global identity. Recognitions like the Chartis RiskTech100® award for Model Validation underscore domain expertise.
*   **Technology & Innovation:** Significant investments are being made in technology, with a focus on GenAI, cloud, and agile development.

Employee training in GenAI is underway.
*   **Sustainability/ESG:** ESG is integrated into the business. Crisil ESG Ratings & Analytics Limited received its SEBI license as a Category 1 ESG Rating Provider. The company published both a BRSR (part of Annual Report) and a separate ESG report for 2024, with core BRSR metrics receiving 'Reasonable Assurance'. Sustainability highlights include emission reductions, increased renewable energy use (67%), waste recycling (91%), tree plantation (70,000+), and supply chain sustainability initiatives.
*   **Human Capital:** Recognized as a 'Great Place to Work®' and among 'India's Best Workplaces™ for Women 2024'. Focus on integrated talent management, upskilling (especially in AI), leadership development, and inclusion (formalized Inclusion Forum, enhanced maternity benefits). Employee engagement remains a priority (e.g., 'Chirp' internal network, Innovation Jam).
*   **Collaboration & Outreach:** Continued strong collaboration with parent S&P Global across various segments (GAC support for S&P Ratings, joint research, data sharing, referrals). Extensive market engagement through flagship events (India Outlook, Infrastructure Summit, NBFC Seminar), regional conclaves, webinars, and publications enhanced brand visibility and thought leadership.
*   **Corporate Actions:** Strategic streamlining includes the proposed merger of Bridge to India Energy Private Limited into Crisil Limited and the business transfer/deregistration involving Peter Lee Associates Pty Limited in Australia.

## Financial Analysis Report: Crisil Limited - Year Ended December 31, 2024

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The Independent Auditor, Walker Chandiok & Co LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The statements are reported to give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013. The opinion on consolidated statements is based partly on the reports of other auditors for certain subsidiaries and branches. No qualifications or adverse remarks were noted in the main audit report or the Secretarial Audit Report.

### Key Accounting Policies

The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual basis, conforming to Ind AS notified under the Companies Act, 2013. Key accounting policies consistently applied include:

*   **Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):** Complexities noted, particularly for initial rating fees (portion deferred for surveillance), subscription services (time proportion), and project-based services like infrastructure consulting (percentage completion method based on costs incurred). Revenue recognition was identified as a Key Audit Matter due to significant judgments involved.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities are recognized, with specific criteria for lease term determination and exclusions for short-term/low-value leases.
*   **Financial Instruments (Ind AS 109):** Classification based on business models (amortised cost, FVTOCI, FVTPL). Impairment is assessed using the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, with a simplified approach for trade receivables. Derivatives are used for hedging foreign exchange risk, primarily using cash flow hedges.
*   **Business Combinations (Ind AS 103):** Accounted for using the acquisition method; goodwill measured as consideration less net identifiable assets acquired at fair value.
*   **Impairment:** Goodwill tested annually; other non-financial assets tested upon indication; financial assets assessed via ECL model.
*   **Share-Based Payments (Ind AS 102):** Fair value expensed over the vesting period.

No significant changes in accounting policies were reported for the year ended December 31, 2024, beyond consistent application of existing Ind AS.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

The Auditors issued an unqualified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements as of December 31, 2024. Management confirmed the existence of adequate internal financial controls and processes, supported by a multi-layered compliance monitoring framework involving business functions, compliance tools, internal audits, and Board/Committee reviews.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

The Secretarial Audit Report confirmed compliance with major applicable statutes including the Companies Act, 2013, SCRA, 1956, Depositories Act, 1996, FEMA, 1999 (for FDI/ODI), and relevant SEBI regulations (Insider Trading, Share-Based Benefits, Research Analysts, LODR, etc.). Directors' Responsibility Statement affirms the existence of adequate systems for compliance. Two minor penalties were disclosed: ₹1.46 lakh related to GST input tax credit reversal (appealed) and ₹0.06 lakh related to Connecticut withholding taxes (response being filed). No material non-compliance or significant penalties impacting operations were reported.

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

Contingent liabilities primarily relate to disputed tax demands (Income Tax, Service Tax, GST) aggregating approximately ₹65.3 crore (Consolidated) and ₹60.5 crore (Standalone) as of December 31, 2024. The Company has contested these demands. No significant or material orders from regulators/courts impacting the going concern status or future operations were reported.

### Related Party Transactions

Significant related party transactions occur primarily with the ultimate holding company group (S&P Global Inc. and its subsidiaries) and Crisil's own subsidiaries. Key transactions involve providing/receiving professional, analytical, and support services, reimbursements, and dividend payments. Transactions are stated to be conducted in the ordinary course of business and on an arm's length basis, pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Shareholder approval (excluding S&P Global) was obtained for transactions with S&P entities. Details are disclosed in Notes 39 (Consolidated) & 40 (Standalone) and Annexure AOC-2.

### Subsequent Events

*   **Dividend:** The Board proposed a final dividend of ₹26 per share for FY2024, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on April 30, 2025.
*   **Mergers:** Processes for the merger of wholly-owned subsidiary Bridge To India Energy Private Limited with Crisil Limited (NCLT application filed Nov 2024) and the business transfer from Peter Lee Associates Pty Limited to Crisil Irevna Australia Pty Ltd (closed Dec 2024) are ongoing or recently concluded parts of entity streamlining.

### Analysis of Accounting Quality

Accounting quality appears reasonable, supported by unqualified audit opinions and adherence to Ind AS. The consistent application of policies enhances reliability. However, the identification of Revenue Recognition as a Key Audit Matter underscores the significant judgments and estimates involved, particularly concerning performance obligation satisfaction and cost estimation for percentage-of-completion contracts. This area requires careful management oversight and represents a potential source of estimation uncertainty. Disclosures regarding critical estimates (impairment, leases, defined benefits, taxes) seem adequate.

### Regulatory Risk Assessment

Crisil operates in highly regulated sectors (credit ratings, financial research, ESG ratings) across multiple jurisdictions (India, US, UK, Europe, APAC), exposing it to significant regulatory risk. Key areas include compliance with SEBI regulations (CRA, Research Analyst, ESG Ratings Provider, LODR), international financial regulations, data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA etc.), and cybersecurity mandates. The establishment of robust compliance frameworks, dedicated compliance functions, and regular audits (Statutory, Secretarial, Internal) act as mitigants. Cybersecurity and data privacy are highlighted as key operational and regulatory risks requiring continuous investment and vigilance. Minor tax disputes indicate ongoing engagement with fiscal authorities. Overall regulatory risk is assessed as moderate but inherent to the business model, requiring proactive management.
