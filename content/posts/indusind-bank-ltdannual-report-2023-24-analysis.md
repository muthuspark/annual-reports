## Risk Analysis of IndusInd Bank (FY 2023-2024)

This analysis categorizes and evaluates IndusInd Bank's risks based on the provided Integrated Annual Report, focusing on severity, likelihood, trend, mitigation, control effectiveness, and financial impact.

    *   Failure to achieve "Market Share with Diversification" goals (Growth, Granularity, Governance - 3G).
    *   Inability to successfully execute on key themes: retailization, domain diversification, scaling sub-scale businesses, Digital 2.0, and ESG integration.
*   **Severity:** High. Failure here directly impacts long-term growth and profitability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. The Bank demonstrates progress, but external factors (economic slowdown, competition) and internal execution challenges exist.
*   **Trend:** Stable. PC-6 strategy is in its first year, showing alignment with objectives, but sustained monitoring is crucial.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

Key performance indicators (KPIs) like retail loan mix (56% vs. 55%-60% target) and retail deposit growth (44% vs. 45%-50% target) show the Bank is near its goals, but still has work to do.
