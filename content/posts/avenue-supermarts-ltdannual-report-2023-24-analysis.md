*   **Trend:** Increasing. Competitive intensity is referenced repeatedly, along with the growth of organized retail and e-retail.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Cluster-based expansion, focus on financial fundamentals, and a customer-centric approach are referenced.

Sensitivity: Market share loss to competitors could negatively impact revenue growth and profitability, although precise figures cannot be presented without additional data.
*   **Scenario 4: Successful Execution of Expansion Plans:** Rapid, successful store expansion could lead to exceeding revenue and profit targets. Sensitivity: Store growth significantly contributes to revenue; exceeding the target of 41 new stores per year could substantially boost financial performance.
*   **Scenario 5: Successful Water Management:** Water conservation projects replenish more than 40% of total water consumption.
*   **Scenario 6: Successful Waste Management:** The waste management practices have created an environment where waste generation is very limited.
