*   **Consistent Application:** The Company applies Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) consistently and has maintained a robust internal control system.
*   **Estimates and Judgments:** Revenue recognition involves estimates for sales returns, discounts, and rebates, which are inherently subjective. The Company uses historical experience and contract terms to make these estimates.
*   **Provisions:** The Company has created provisions related to certain legal contingencies, but acknowledges uncertainty in the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.

### Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **High Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a pharmaceutical company, Dr. Reddy's operates in a highly regulated environment, subject to inspections and oversight by various agencies, including the USFDA, NPPA, and other global regulatory bodies. Compliance with cGMP standards is critical.
*   **Ongoing Litigation:** The ongoing legal proceedings, especially the U.S. antitrust litigations and the internal investigation, represent a significant regulatory risk. Adverse outcomes could result in substantial financial penalties and reputational damage.
*   **Pricing Regulations:** The Company faces regulatory risks related to drug pricing regulations, particularly in India, which could impact profitability.
*   **Data Privacy:** The Company, though not suffering any data breaches, does face a risk in cybersecurity and digital operations.
