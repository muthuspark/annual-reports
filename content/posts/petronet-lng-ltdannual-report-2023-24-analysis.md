## Risk Framework

### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Reliance on long-term LNG contracts presents a high severity risk due to potential shifts in global energy markets and geopolitical issues.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Geopolitical events and global energy market volatility are ongoing.
*   **Trend:** Stable but increasing. Increasing global competition and energy transition could present challenges. The Petrochemical project brings about new risks with respect to price and competition.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Diversification of supply, focus on the domestic market, expansion of regasification facilities, and entry into petrochemicals.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. Long-term contracts provide secured business, while infrastructure expansion increases capacity. The Petrochemical complex mitigates reliance.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Substantial. Volatility in LNG prices or disruptions in supply could significantly impact revenue and profitability.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Issues at Dahej or Kochi terminals (e.g., accidents, operational disruptions) could be severe.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. Both terminals have high HSE standards and 5-star ratings from the British Safety Council.
*   **Trend:** Stable. Consistent high capacity utilization and safety records indicate a stable trend.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Strict adherence to HSE protocols, regular safety audits, emergency preparedness drills, proactive maintenance, and employee training. Implementation of the online HSE management portal 'Suraksha Setu'.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** High. The 5-star safety ratings and achievement of significant accident-free man-hours suggest strong operational controls.

### Financial Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium to high.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Trend:** Volatile.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Hedging as per Board approved policy.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. Hedging and pass-through mechanisms provide some protection, but volatility remains a factor.

### Compliance/Regulatory Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. The Company maintains a track of Compliance.
*   **Trend:** Stable.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Comprehensive legal and regulatory compliance programs, internal audits, and engagement with regulatory bodies.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** High.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Medium. Non-compliance could lead to fines, penalties, and reputational damage.

### Emerging Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Transition to a gas-based economy, and global LNG pricing volatility, pose both risks and opportunities. Petrochemical risks are not yet evaluated.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. The global focus on renewable energy and the transition to net-zero goals.
*   **Trend:** Increasing.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Diversification efforts into petrochemicals, investment in renewable energy sources (solar power at Kochi), and exploration of green hydrogen initiatives.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Developing stage. The effectiveness will depend on the successful execution of diversification strategies.

### Potential Challenges and Opportunities

*   **Opportunities:**
    *   Growing natural gas demand in India, driven by government policies.
    *   Expansion of gas infrastructure, including pipelines and CGD networks.
    *   Potential for LNG as a transition fuel and in transportation.
    *   Diversification into petrochemicals.
    *   New business initiatives like CBG plants and green hydrogen.
    *   Overseas Project-Supply of LNG for Kerawalapitiya Power Plant, Sri Lanka

*   **Challenges:**
    *   Geopolitical risks affecting global LNG prices and supply.
    *   Delay in start-up of new LNG projects.
    *   Increase in domestic gas production impacting LNG import demand.
    *   Delay in connectivity of pipelines with LNG Terminals.
    *   Adverse regulations or policies impacting the LNG sector.

### Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity

*   **LNG Pricing:** Volatility in global LNG spot prices, as seen in the past, poses a significant risk. The company's long-term contracts provide some stability, but spot purchases are exposed to price fluctuations. Sensitivity analysis shows significant impact on revenue based on price and INR/USD assumptions.
*   **Foreign Exchange Risk:** The company is exposed to fluctuations in INR/USD exchange rates. A 10% movement in the exchange rate could significantly impact profit or loss, highlighting a need for robust hedging strategies.
* **Energy Efficiency:** The efficiency is being improved.
* **Capacity Utilization:** The Report indicates focus on increased capacity utilization to achieve targets.

## Audit and Compliance Analysis

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   The auditor issued an unqualified opinion on the standalone and consolidated financial statements, indicating compliance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.
*   An emphasis of matter was included regarding the recoverability of trade receivables related to "Use or Pay" (UoP) dues, with the opinion remaining unmodified.
*   The auditors did not audit the financial statements of 2 subsidiaries.
*   Auditors were unable to comment on qualifications for one joint venture, since unaudited statements were used.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   The Company consistently applied accounting policies.
*   No significant changes in accounting policies were noted, but there were changes in estimates of actuarial assumptions.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   The auditor's report states that the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to standalone financial statements, and such controls were operating effectively.
*   Management asserts responsibility for establishing and maintaining internal controls.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

### Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The unqualified audit opinion, consistent application of accounting policies, and the presence of a robust internal control system suggest good accounting quality. However, the emphasis of matter regarding the "Use or Pay" dues indicates a potential area of concern, although the auditor's opinion is not modified. The lack of balance confirmation from customers regarding these dues increases the risk, but the provision made by the company is a mitigating factor.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The Company appears to be generally compliant with regulations, with past issues related to board composition. No penalties related to the capital market were noted. The legal proceedings, while ongoing, are disclosed, and the Company is actively contesting them.
