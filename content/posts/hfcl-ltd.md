## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis covers the key aspects of HFCL Limited's Annual Report for the financial year 2023-24, focusing on financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

HFCL reported a consolidated revenue from operations of ₹4,465 crore in FY24, a slight decrease from ₹4,743 crore in FY23.  However, this decline is attributed to a temporary slowdown in the global OFC market, partially offset by growth in other segments.  Key financial highlights include:

* **Revenue from Operations:** ₹4,465 crore (FY24), ₹4,743 crore (FY23) - slight decrease
* **EBITDA:** ₹682 crore (FY24), ₹666 crore (FY23) - increase of 2.44%
* **Profit Before Tax (PBT):** ₹454 crore (FY24), ₹431 crore (FY23) - increase of 5.44%
* **Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹338 crore (FY24), ₹318 crore (FY23) - increase of 6.24%
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** ₹2.33 (FY24), ₹2.18 (FY23) - increase
* **Return on Capital Employed (RoCE):** 13.5% (FY24)
* **Debt-Equity Ratio:** 0.24x (FY24) - healthy level
* **Order Book:** >₹7,600 crore (as of March 31, 2024) - strong revenue visibility

The improved EBITDA and PAT margins (15.28% and 7.56% respectively in FY24) despite lower revenue highlight better operational efficiency and cost management.  The significant increase in other income (₹100.59 crore in FY24 vs. ₹47.18 crore in FY23) is mainly due to a favorable arbitration award.  The company's financial risk profile appears healthy, with comfortable debt coverage indicators.  A successful Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) further strengthened their financial position.

**II. Business Segments:**

HFCL operates in three key sectors: Telecom, Defence, and Railways.  The company is strategically shifting from a project-focused to a product-centric revenue model, aiming for higher margins and faster revenue realisation.

* **Telecom:**  This segment contributes the highest revenue (92% in FY24).  Key offerings include optical fiber, optical fiber cables (OFC), Wi-Fi access points, backhaul radios (UBR), 5G FWA CPE, and network management systems.  HFCL is the #1 OFC supplier in India and a leading player in other telecom products.  Significant growth is anticipated in FY25 (₹2,000 crore projected vs. ₹143 crore in FY24).
* **Defence:**  This segment is relatively smaller (6% revenue contribution in FY24), but demonstrates a strategic focus on diversification and growth. Key offerings include electronic fuzes, thermal weapon sights, surveillance radars, and secure communication networks.  The company is aiming for a 10-15% revenue share from defence by FY27.  Significant orders for 5G networking equipment and BSNL upgrades were secured during the year.
* **Railways:** This segment focuses on modernizing railway communication systems, including video surveillance systems, telecom networks for freight corridors, and metro rail integration.


**III. Risks:**

The Annual Report identifies many key risk factors:

* **Economic Risk:**  General economic slowdown or sector-specific challenges could impact demand and growth.  The report highlights the company's strategies for mitigating this risk through diversification and financial flexibility.
* **Competition:** Intense competition requires continuous innovation and strong customer relationships to maintain market share.
* **Foreign Exchange Risk:** Fluctuations in exchange rates impact import/export activities.  The company employs hedging strategies to mitigate this risk.
* **Technology Risk:** Rapid technological advancements could render some products obsolete.  Continued R&D investments are essential for staying competitive.
* **Government Policy Risk:** Changes in government policies and regulations could affect operations.  The company actively monitors policy developments and adjusts its strategies accordingly.


**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

HFCL demonstrates a commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles through various initiatives:

* **Environment:**
    * **Energy Conservation:**  Reduced energy consumption by 16% and GHG emission intensity by 2% in FY24.  Investments in solar power systems are underway at many locations.
    * **Waste Management:** Reduced total waste generation by 18% and achieved an 84% reduction in waste disposal.  Focus on recycling and responsible waste management.
    * **Water Management:**  Water recycling and rainwater harvesting initiatives are in place.  A goal of Zero Liquid Discharge is being pursued.
* **Social:**
    * **Employee Well-being:**  Emphasis on employee training (26,000+ hours in FY24), promoting diversity and inclusion (Future Women Leaders program), and providing healthcare and wellness programs.
    * **Community Engagement:**  Significant CSR spending (₹2.42 crore in FY24), supporting healthcare in underserved communities, providing education and skill development opportunities, and promoting animal welfare.  Over 1.42 lakh beneficiaries were impacted through CSR programs.
* **Governance:**
    * Strong corporate governance framework, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the Board and its committees.
    * Regular Board and committee meetings.
    * Robust risk management processes and internal control systems.
    * Transparency and disclosure practices.

**V. Conclusion:**

HFCL's Annual Report reveals a company focused on growth, diversification, and sustainable business practices.  While a temporary slowdown in the OFC market impacted FY24 revenue, the strong order book, strategic shift towards product-centric revenue, and continued investment in R&D position the company for long-term growth.  Their commitment to ESG initiatives strengthens their brand and enhances stakeholder value.  However, close monitoring of identified risks, especially those related to economic conditions and competition, will remain essential for sustained success.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
Based on the provided HFCL Limited Annual Report for FY24:

* **Total Assets:** ₹6,130 crore (Standalone)  and ₹6,487 crore (Consolidated)
* **Current Assets:** ₹4,245 crore (Standalone) and ₹4,534 crore (Consolidated)
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹20.86 crore (Standalone) and ₹23.33 crore (Consolidated)
* **Accounts Receivable:** ₹2,127 crore (Standalone) and ₹2,215 crore (Consolidated)
* **Inventory:** ₹619 crore (Standalone) and ₹774 crore (Consolidated)


Note that there are slight discrepancies depending on whether you are looking at the standalone or consolidated financial statements.  The consolidated figures include the financial performance of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities.

### Liability Analysis
Based on the HFCL Limited Annual Report for FY24:

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹2,308 crore (Standalone) and ₹2,487 crore (Consolidated)
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹2,045 crore (Standalone) and ₹2,184 crore (Consolidated)
* **Long-term Debt:** ₹135 crore (Standalone, including lease liabilities) and ₹169 crore (Consolidated, including lease liabilities)
* **Accounts Payable:** ₹836 crore (Standalone) and ₹808 crore (Consolidated)


Again, note the difference between standalone and consolidated figures.  The consolidated numbers represent the combined liabilities of the parent company and its subsidiaries.  The long-term debt figure specifically excludes current maturities of long-term debt, which are included in current liabilities.

### Equity Analysis
Based on the HFCL Limited Annual Report for FY24:

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹3,822 crore (Standalone) and ₹3,956 crore (Consolidated).  Note that the Consolidated figure includes non-controlling interests.
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹1,960 crore (Standalone) and ₹2,092 crore (Consolidated)
* **Share Capital:** ₹144 crore (Standalone) and ₹144 crore (Consolidated)


The consolidated figures include the equity of subsidiaries and reflect non-controlling interests.  The difference between the total equity and the sum of retained earnings and share capital is due to other equity components, such as securities premium, share-based payment reserve, and other reserves.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
The provided annual report gives slightly different figures depending on whether you're looking at the standalone or consolidated financial statements. Here's a breakdown of the key figures for both:


**Standalone Financial Statements**

* **Revenue:** ₹4,175 crore
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹3,647 crore (This includes cost of material consumed, other direct costs, and the change in inventories.)
* **Gross Profit:** ₹527 crore (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)
* **Operating Expenses:** ₹3,647 crore (This seems to be an error and may represent Total Expenses instead.  The report does not clearly separate Operating Expenses from Non-Operating Expenses)
* **Operating Income:**  The report doesn't explicitly state operating income,  but based on the data provided, it would be calculated as:  Revenue - Cost of Revenue - Operating Expenses. Given the apparent error in reporting operating expenses, precise Operating Income can't be reliably calculated.  The closest approximation would be the Profit Before Finance Cost and Tax (₹527 crore),  but this also includes non-operating income.


**Consolidated Financial Statements**

* **Revenue:** ₹4,566 crore
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹3,965 crore (This includes cost of material consumed, other direct costs, and the change in inventories.)
* **Gross Profit:** ₹600 crore (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)
* **Operating Expenses:** ₹3,965 crore (This includes cost of revenue and other operating expenses. The report does not clearly separate Operating Expenses from Non-Operating Expenses)
* **Operating Income:**  Similar to the standalone figures, precise operating income cannot be definitively calculated from the provided data due to the lack of clear separation of operating and non-operating expenses. Profit Before Finance Cost and Tax (₹600 crore) provides a close but not precise approximation, as it includes non-operating income.


**Important Note:** The annual report's presentation of expenses is not entirely clear.  It combines many expense categories, making it difficult to extract a precise "operating expenses" figure separate from other expenses.  The figures above should be considered estimates based on the available information.  For precise operating income, you would need to refer to a more detailed breakdown of expenses.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Here's a summary of Net Income, EBITDA, Basic EPS, and Diluted EPS from HFCL's FY24 annual report, again noting the differences between standalone and consolidated figures:

**Standalone Financial Statements**

* **Net Income (PAT):** ₹309.66 crore
* **EBITDA:** ₹527.47 crore (before exceptional items and tax)
* **Basic EPS:** ₹2.19
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹2.19

**Consolidated Financial Statements**

* **Net Income (PAT):** ₹337.52 crore
* **EBITDA:** ₹600.37 crore (before exceptional items and tax; includes share of profit from jointly controlled entities)
* **Basic EPS:** ₹2.33
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹2.33


Remember that the consolidated figures represent the performance of the entire group, including subsidiaries, while standalone figures reflect only the parent company's performance.  The EBITDA figure in the consolidated statement includes the share of profit from jointly controlled entities.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Here's a summary of the cash flow statement information from HFCL's FY24 annual report, again showing the differences between the standalone and consolidated figures:

**Standalone Statement of Cash Flows**

* **Cash flow from operating activities:**  -₹110.90 crore
* **Cash flow from investing activities:** -₹409.91 crore
* **Cash flow from financing activities:** ₹480.32 crore


**Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows**

* **Cash flow from operating activities:** -₹44.87 crore
* **Cash flow from investing activities:** -₹448.72 crore
* **Cash flow from financing activities:** ₹454.01 crore


**Important Note:**  Negative values indicate a net cash outflow for that activity.  The significant differences between the standalone and consolidated cash flows emphasize the importance of considering the entire group's financial activity when analyzing HFCL's overall liquidity and financial health.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The provided annual report doesn't directly state the free cash flow.  Free cash flow (FCF) is calculated, and its calculation requires information not explicitly provided in the summary data.  A precise FCF calculation would necessitate a more detailed income statement and balance sheet.  However, we can estimate some components:


Based on the HFCL Limited Annual Report for FY24:


**Estimating Components of Free Cash Flow Calculation:**

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  The report provides some CAPEX information but not a single, total figure. To estimate CAPEX you would need to sum the additions to property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets from both the standalone and consolidated statements.  This would likely be a significant amount.

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹28.55 crore (Standalone) and ₹28.55 crore (Consolidated)  (This is stated explicitly)

**Free Cash Flow (FCF) Estimation:**

To estimate FCF, one typically uses a formula like this:

FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures + Proceeds from Sale of Assets

The annual report provides operating cash flow and information about capital expenditures (though requiring summation),  and proceeds from asset sales.  However, a precise number cannot be extracted without a more detailed analysis of the financial statements.

In short:  The report provides the necessary data *elements* to calculate free cash flow, but not a direct free cash flow number.  Further calculations would be needed using the provided figures.



## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
The provided annual report doesn't explicitly state all of these profitability ratios, and calculating them requires careful attention to the presentation of the financial statements, which, as noted earlier, isn't completely transparent in its separation of operating and non-operating expenses.  Therefore, the following should be considered estimates based on the available data, and might slightly differ depending on the exact categorization of expenses.


**Estimates Based on Available Data:**

It's essential to remember that these calculations are based on the summary data provided.  More precise figures would require a more detailed breakdown from the full financial statements.

**Standalone Financial Statements**

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (₹527 crore / ₹4,175 crore) * 100% = 12.63%  (This uses Profit Before Finance Cost and Tax as a proxy for Gross Profit.  A more accurate Gross Profit figure is not readily available.)
* **Operating Profit Margin:** Cannot be reliably calculated due to the unclear separation of operating and non-operating expenses in the provided data.
* **Net Profit Margin:** (₹309.66 crore / ₹4,175 crore) * 100% = 7.41%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (₹309.66 crore / ₹2,993 crore) * 100% = 10.35% (Using average equity)
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (₹309.66 crore / ₹5,080 crore) * 100% = 6.10% (Using average total assets)


**Consolidated Financial Statements**

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (₹600 crore / ₹4,566 crore) * 100% = 13.14% (This uses Profit Before Finance Cost and Tax as a proxy for Gross Profit and includes share of profit from jointly controlled entities. A more accurate Gross Profit figure is not readily available.)
* **Operating Profit Margin:** Cannot be reliably calculated due to the unclear separation of operating and non-operating expenses in the provided data.
* **Net Profit Margin:** (₹337.52 crore / ₹4,566 crore) * 100% = 7.39%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (₹337.52 crore / ₹3,107.54 crore) * 100% = 10.86% (Using average equity, includes non-controlling interest)
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (₹337.52 crore / ₹5,472.59 crore) * 100% = 6.17% (Using average total assets)


**Important Note:**  The calculations for gross profit margin are approximate because the report does not clearly separate operating expenses from other expenses.  Therefore, the operating profit margin cannot be accurately calculated from the information presented. The ROE and ROA calculations utilize average equity and assets for the year. More detailed financial statements would be needed to calculate these ratios with greater precision.

### Liquidity Ratios
Again, precise calculation of these ratios requires a more detailed breakdown of the balance sheet than is provided in the summary data.  The following are estimates based on the available information, and there will be slight differences depending on whether you use standalone or consolidated figures.


**Estimates Based on Available Data:**

**Standalone Financial Statements**

* **Current Ratio:** (₹4,245 crore / ₹2,045 crore) = 2.08x
* **Quick Ratio:** Cannot be calculated precisely without a more detailed breakdown of current assets to separate out inventories.  The quick ratio excludes inventories from current assets.
* **Cash Ratio:** (₹20.86 crore / ₹2,045 crore) = 0.01x


**Consolidated Financial Statements**

* **Current Ratio:** (₹4,534 crore / ₹2,184 crore) = 2.08x
* **Quick Ratio:** Cannot be calculated precisely without a more detailed breakdown of current assets to separate out inventories. The quick ratio excludes inventories from current assets.
* **Cash Ratio:** (₹23.33 crore / ₹2,184 crore) = 0.01x


**Important Note:**  The cash ratio is extremely low in both cases, suggesting that the Company may have limited immediate liquidity based solely on cash and cash equivalents to cover its short-term obligations. The quick ratio cannot be determined without further information.  These are rough estimates; the full financial statements are needed for precise calculation.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating these efficiency ratios accurately requires more detailed information from the full financial statements than is provided in the summary data. Specifically, we need the precise figures for Cost of Goods Sold and average inventory and receivables over the year.  The report provides some data elements, but not the precise averages needed for accurate calculations.


**Estimates and Considerations:**

The following are estimates based on the available data and involve assumptions:

* **Asset Turnover:**  This ratio is calculated as Revenue / Average Total Assets.  The report provides year-end values for total assets; using the year-end figures *as a proxy* for the average would oversimplify the calculation, especially considering the significant changes in assets during the year.  A precise calculation would necessitate the average total assets figure.

* **Inventory Turnover:** This ratio is calculated as Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory. The report does not provide the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) figure directly for either the standalone or consolidated statements.  We can approximate COGS using the cost of materials consumed and other direct costs.  However, average inventory values are also not explicitly given, only year-end numbers.

* **Receivables Turnover:** This ratio is calculated as Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable. Again, the report only provides year-end figures for accounts receivable, not averages for the year.


In summary: While some data elements are available to estimate these ratios, a precise calculation isn't feasible based solely on the provided summary. The full financial statements are necessary for accurate computation.  Using year-end numbers as a proxy for averages would significantly impact accuracy.

### Leverage Ratios
Calculating use ratios precisely requires the complete financial statements, specifically needing average values for debt and equity over the fiscal year. The report provides year-end figures, but using those as proxies for averages would result in less accurate calculations.


**Estimates Based on Year-End Data (Less Accurate):**

These calculations use year-end values as a proxy for averages, which is a simplification that reduces accuracy:

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** (₹2,308 crore / ₹3,822 crore) = 0.60 (Using year-end figures)
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** (₹2,308 crore / ₹6,130 crore) = 0.38 (Using year-end figures)
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:**  (₹412.45 crore + ₹58.48 crore) / ₹115.02 crore = 4.08x  (Using Profit Before Tax + Depreciation/Amortization as a proxy for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) )

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** (₹2,487 crore / ₹3,999.82 crore) = 0.62 (Using year-end figures)
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** (₹2,487 crore / ₹6,487 crore) = 0.38 (Using year-end figures)
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** (₹454.02 crore + ₹81.76 crore) / ₹147.28 crore = 3.65x (Using Profit Before Tax + Depreciation/Amortization as a proxy for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) )


**Important Note:**  These are estimates using year-end figures.  The actual use ratios, especially the debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios, would likely be slightly different if calculated using average debt and equity figures for the entire year.  The interest coverage ratio uses a simplified proxy for EBIT; a more precise calculation requires a clearer separation of operating and non-operating income. The full financial statements are necessary for accurate computations.





## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided annual report does *not* contain market capitalization, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, dividend yield, or dividend payout ratio.  These are market-based metrics that are not included in company-prepared financial statements.  To obtain these values, you would need to consult a financial website such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg, using HFCL's stock ticker symbol.  These sites will provide real-time or historical data based on the current market price of HFCL's stock and other relevant market data.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The annual report provides some information on HFCL's business segments, but a complete picture requires piecing together data from different sections.  Precise figures for market share aren't explicitly provided.  Also, the report doesn't consistently separate operating margins for each segment, but mentions targets and trends.  Geographic presence is detailed for OFC but less so for other products.


**Estimates Based on Report Data (Inconsistent and Incomplete):**

The following is a summary incorporating data scattered throughout the report, noting its inconsistencies:

**1. Telecom Products:**

* **Name:** Telecom Products and Solutions (This is the overall umbrella term.  More granular segmentations aren't clearly defined.)

* **Geographic Presence:** Primarily India, with potential for future export markets.


**Important Note:**  The provided data is not consistent across all segments.  The report focuses more on overall financial results and strategic directions than precise segmental performance breakdowns.  Obtaining precise market share data would require additional research from external sources.  The revenue figures may contain some degree of approximation depending on the allocation of some revenue lines to the particular sectors.




## Risk Management
### Risk Assessment
The HFCL annual report mentions many key risk factors but doesn't provide a structured assessment of likelihood and impact severity for each. The following categorizes and summarizes the risks, inferring likelihood and impact based on the report's description and context:

**I. Financial Risks:**

| Risk Category           | Description                                                                                                                           | Impact Severity (High/Medium/Low) | Likelihood (High/Medium/Low) | Mitigation Strategies                                                                                                    | Trends                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Economic Slowdown**   | Macroeconomic conditions (global and domestic) impacting demand for telecom, defence, and railway products and services.                      | High                               | Medium                        | Diversification of revenue streams, financial flexibility, cost optimization                                         | Global economic uncertainty and potential sector-specific slowdowns remain significant ongoing trends.           |
| **Credit Risk**         | Non-payment by customers (especially in government projects), leading to bad debts and impaired receivables.                                      | Medium                              | Medium                        | Stringent credit checks, monitoring of customer financial health, provision for bad debts                                 | Relatively low concentration of risk in government projects, but payment delays are a possibility.                 |
| **Interest Rate Risk**   | Fluctuations in market interest rates impacting the cost of borrowings.                                                                     | Medium                              | Medium                        | Diversification of funding sources, hedging strategies (for floating rate debt)                                       | Rising interest rates globally are a major ongoing factor.                                                |
| **Currency Risk**       | Fluctuations in exchange rates impacting profitability on export/import transactions.                                                              | Medium                              | Medium                        | Hedging strategies, negotiating contracts in INR when possible                                                      | Global currency volatility is a persistent concern.                                                     |

### Audit Information
The auditor's opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements is **unmodified (clean).** This means the auditors, S. Bhandari & Co. LLP and Oswal Sunil & Company, found the financial statements to be presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.


**Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report details numerous accounting policies, but the key ones include:


* **Basis of Preparation:** The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.  The historical cost convention is generally followed, with exceptions for certain financial instruments (measured at fair value), assets held for sale, and defined benefit plans.

* **Business Combinations:**  The acquisition method is used for accounting for business combinations, with identifiable assets and liabilities recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.  Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually.

* **Fair Value Measurement:**  A three-level hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) is used for categorizing inputs into the valuation techniques for fair value measurement.

* **Investments:** Investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):**  PPE is initially recognized at cost and depreciated using the straight-line or written-down value method, based on the asset's useful life.

* **Intangible Assets:**  Research costs are expensed, while development costs are capitalized when specific criteria are met.  Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives.

* **Financial Instruments:**  Financial assets are classified as debt instruments at amortized cost, debt instruments at fair value through other detailed income (FVTOCI), or debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), and equity instruments at fair value through other detailed income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), based on the business model and contractual terms.  Expected credit losses are recognized for impaired financial assets.  Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.

* **Revenue Recognition:**  Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers.  The principles of Ind AS 115 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) are applied.

* **Leases:**  The single accounting model of Ind AS 116 is followed, requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases.

* **Foreign Currency Transactions:** Transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary items are translated at the closing rate, and any exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss.

* **Employee Benefits:**  Short-term employee benefits are recognized at the amounts expected to be paid.  Long-term employee benefits (like gratuity and leave encashment) are measured at present value using actuarial valuations.

* **Income Taxes:**  The income tax expense includes both current and deferred tax components, calculated based on applicable tax rates and laws.


These are some of the key accounting policies. The full annual report provides a more complete and detailed description of the Company's accounting policies.
