## KRN Heat Exchanger & Refrigeration Limited Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Analysis

### Financial Performance

*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   Q3 FY25 Revenue: INR 116.36 crores (73.67% YoY increase)
    *   Q3 FY25 EBITDA: INR 15.81 crores (34.76% YoY increase)
    *   Q3 FY25 Net Profit: INR 13.73 crores (74.44% YoY increase)
    *   9M FY25 Total Income: INR 305.88 crores (32.96% YoY increase)
    *   9M FY25 Net Profit: INR 38.01 crores (39.02% YoY increase)

*   **Comparison:** Significant YoY growth in all key metrics for both Q3 and the 9-month period. Revenue and net profit showed the most substantial increases. Quarter-over-quarter comparison indicates a dip in EBITDA margins.

*   **Revised Guidance/Forecasts:** The company expects the running quarter (Q4 FY25) to be "almost same or maybe we will try to increase like 5%-10% on last."

*   **Areas of Growth/Decline:** Revenue growth driven by increased volume, HVAC phase 1 contribution, and some new North American customers. EBITDA margin saw a dip, attributed to increased employee costs (new hires for upcoming facility) and a temporary rise in raw material prices due to China withdrawing export subsidies.

### Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

*   **Major Strategic Announcements:** Transformational capacity expansion in Neemrana, Rajasthan, under subsidiary KRN HVAC Products Pvt. Ltd. (INR 300+ crores investment).
*   **New Products/Services/Markets:**
    *   Entering high-growth sectors: railway electrification, heavy earth movers, and industrial cooling.
    *   Introduction of Bar and Plate heat exchangers for applications like electric locomotives, off-road vehicles, compressors, and lifters.
    *   Expanding export focus to Europe and North America.
*   **Operational Changes:** Solar energy adoption at the new plant to reduce power costs.

*   **Competitive Positioning:** Aims to be the largest professional heat exchanger manufacturer in India (excluding OEMs) with the new facility.
*   **Market Challenges/Opportunities:** Sees significant export opportunities due to favorable trade policies and the China plus one trend. The USA putting a 25% duty on Mexican imports is seen as a positive. Competitors in Europe and North America are acknowledged, but confidence is expressed in competing effectively.
*   **Market Share:** Not explicitly stated, but implied to be significant in the Indian market, especially in Rajasthan (over 40% of revenue).

### Risk Factors & Challenges
