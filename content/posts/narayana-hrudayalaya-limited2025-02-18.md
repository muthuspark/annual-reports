## Financial Performance

*   **Revenue:** HCCI revenue is INR 293 crores. Combined revenue for Gurugram, Dharamshala, and SRCC is INR 130 crores.
*   **Margins:** New hospitals (Gurugram, Dharamshala, SRCC) EBITDA margin is 6% (up from 3% in Q3 FY24). Dharamshala has a high double-digit EBITDA margin. Cayman margins saw recovery close to usual run rate on an EBITDA basis.
*   **Gross Margin:** Strong gross margin due to consumption mix benefits and efficiencies from lean operations.

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

*   **Cayman Islands:** New hospital outpatient facility commissioned in December. Emergency room, inpatient surgeries commissioned from January 1st. Obstetrics and neonatal care to start mid-February. Integrated Care (insurance policies) sales started in Cayman from January 1st.
*   **Bahamas:** Small investment in the Bahamas.
*   **India Expansion:** Scouting for brownfield opportunities. Greenfield projects planned, with most projects fiscal '28 or beyond. Focus on expanding in Bangalore and Kolkata.
*   **Primary Health Clinics:** Target of 50 clinics in a year, moving into Kolkata. Launched Arya insurance plan (full outpatient, full inpatient). Expect INR 400-500 crores investment in the integrated care business.
*   **Mumbai:** Discussions with Trust to expand SRCC Hospital into a multi-specialty adult program.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

*   **Competition:** Acknowledgment of Apollo and Max in the Gurgaon market.
*   **Industry Trends:** Healthcare becoming unaffordable. Need to access more healthcare via insurance.
*   **Medical Tourism:** Medical tourism from the U.S. to Cayman never materialized as expected.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

*   **Cayman Islands:** Difficulty in hiring new doctors.
*   **Gurgaon Hospital:** Location limits catchment area.
*   **Expansion Delays:** Delays in negotiating contracts and licensing for expansion in India.
*   **Debt Levels:** Potential for increased debt with project finance, targeting Debt-EBITDA levels up to 3.

## Forward-Looking Statements

*   **Cayman Islands:** Expect to commission all service lines by March. See Cayman growth in near quarters.
*   **India:** Expect new units to perform better, with Gurugram leading improvement. Expect continued organic revenue growth.
*   **Primary Health Clinics:** See clinics and insurance as an engine of growth for the integrated care business.
*   **Capex:** INR 400-500 crores investment in integrated care (clinics plus insurance). IRR target of upwards of 15% for projects.
*   **Dividend Policy:** Consistent dividend strategy to continue.

## Q&A Insights

*   **Bahamas Stake Acquisition:** The rationale for 4% acquisition is an initial step to increase that, to learn more about the market, or to see whether there is a potential to expand into the Bahamas.
*   **Acquisition Target:** A potential acquisition has to be in our core market: Bangalore or Kolkata, or second priority, Delhi or Raipur.
*   **Utilization of Cayman cash proceeds**: Investment in Bahamas is a key consideration, with the Indian market being the top priority.

## Management Tone & Sentiment

*   **Confident:** About the potential for synergies between Bahamas and Cayman.
*   **Pragmatic:** Acknowledging the difficulty in acquiring brownfield assets at the right price. Cautious about scaling up the clinic business too fast.
*   **Committed:** To integrated care model and expanding primary health clinics.
