## Operating Performance

### Revenue Analysis

#### Revenue Breakdown by Segment/Geography

Dreamfolks Services Ltd. reported a consolidated revenue from operations of INR 11,349.96 million for FY2024, a 46.77% increase from INR 7,733.00 million in FY2023. Standalone revenue also grew by 46.77%.

*   **Segmental Revenue:** The primary revenue driver is airport lounge access services. Revenue from services other than Indian airport lounges grew to 6% of total revenue in FY2024, up from less than 2% in FY2022. The company aims for 15-20% contribution in the next 4-5 years.
*   **Geographical Revenue:** The majority of revenue is generated within India. Exports contributed 0.02% of the total turnover for FY2024. The company is expanding globally, including entry into Malaysia and a subsidiary in Singapore, expected to increase international revenue.

### Cost Structure Analysis (FY2024)

*   **Cost of Services:** INR 9,975.31 million (87.89% of revenue).
*   **Employee Benefits Expenses:** INR 292.20 million (2.57% of revenue), including INR 60.09 million non-cash ESOP expense.
*   **Depreciation and Amortization Expenses:** INR 50.13 million (0.44% of revenue).
*   **Finance Costs:** INR 7.23 million (0.06% of revenue).
*   **Other Expenses:** INR 100.56 million (0.89% of revenue).

The cost structure is dominated by the cost of services. Operating expenses form a relatively small proportion of total revenue.

### Margin Analysis

#### Gross Margin

*   FY2024: 12.11%
*   FY2023: 12.93%
*   A slight compression in gross margin by approximately 82 basis points YoY.

#### Adjusted EBITDA Margin

*   FY2024: 9.1% (Adjusted EBITDA INR 1,033 million).
*   Calculated EBITDA for FY24: INR 981.89 million (8.65% margin).

#### Net Profit Margin (Attributable to Owners)

*   FY2024: 6.05%
*   FY2023: 9.38%
*   Net profit margin saw a decline of approximately 333 basis points YoY.

### Operating Leverage

Dreamfolks operates on an asset-light business model.

*   Employee benefit expenses as a percentage of revenue remained relatively stable.
*   Depreciation and amortization also remained a small, stable percentage of revenue.
The significant growth in revenue (46.77%) outpacing the growth in operating expenses implies some degree of positive operating leverage, although the compression in gross and net margins indicates that cost pressures or changes in service mix might have partially offset these benefits in FY2024.

### Non-Recurring Items

*   **Profit on disposal of Investment property:** INR 1.25 million.
*   **Gain on sale on financials instruments measured at FVTPL - Profit on sale of debt fund:** INR 1.92 million.
*   **Gain on sale on financials instruments measured at FVTPL - On change of fair value of debt fund measured at FVTPL:** INR 2.18 million.
*   **Tax expense related to earlier years:** Charge of INR 0.27 million.
These items are relatively small and are unlikely to have a material distorting effect on the underlying operational performance analysis.

### GAAP vs. Non-GAAP Reconciliation

The company uses "Adjusted EBITDA" as a key performance indicator. The annual report does not provide a specific reconciliation schedule detailing the adjustments made to arrive at "Adjusted EBITDA" from a GAAP measure like Profit Before Tax or reported EBITDA.

*   Cost of Services: FY24: 9,974.55; FY23: 6,809.84
*   Inventory: Not applicable due to service nature.

#### Debtors' Turnover Ratio (Revenue / Avg. Trade Receivables)

*   FY24: 11,349.46 / ((2679.51 + 2054.23)/2) = 11,349.46 / 2366.87 = **4.80 times**
*   FY23: 7,733.02 / ((2054.23 + 604.88)/2) = 7,733.02 / 1329.56 = **5.82 times** (Assuming FY22 receivables were 604.88 based on FY23 MD&A's trade receivable turnover of 6.26x and Revenue of 3760.7. If unavailable, using opening FY23 for denominator: 7733.02/2054.23 = 3.76 times. The MD&A provides a ratio of 4.7x for FY24 and 6.2x for FY23.)

#### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) (Avg. Trade Receivables / Revenue * 365)

*   FY24: (2366.87 / 11349.46) * 365 = **76.1 days** (MD&A: Debtors' Turnover N/A but ratio is 4.7x, implying ~77.6 days)
*   FY23: (1329.56 / 7733.02) * 365 = **62.7 days** (MD&A: Debtors' Turnover N/A but ratio is 6.2x, implying ~58.9 days)
*   *DSO increased, indicating a longer collection period.*

#### Creditors' Turnover Ratio (Cost of Services / Avg. Trade Payables)

*   FY24: 9,974.55 / ((1625.36 + 1393.11)/2) = 9,974.55 / 1509.24 = **6.61 times**
*   FY23: 6,809.84 / ((1393.11 + 370.02)/2) = 6,809.84 / 881.57 = **7.72 times** (Assuming FY22 payables. The MD&A states a ratio of 6.7x for FY24 and 7.1x for FY23.)

#### Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) (Avg. Trade Payables / Cost of Services * 365)

*   FY24: (1509.24 / 9974.55) * 365 = **55.2 days** (MD&A: Trade payables turnover N/A but ratio is 6.7x, implying ~54.5 days)
*   FY23: (881.57 / 6809.84) * 365 = **47.2 days** (MD&A: Trade payables turnover N/A but ratio is 7.1x, implying ~51.4 days)
*   *DPO increased, indicating the company is taking longer to pay its suppliers.*

#### Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) (DSO - DPO, as Inventory is nil)

*   Using calculated figures: FY24: 76.1 - 55.2 = **20.9 days**; FY23: 62.7 - 47.2 = **15.5 days**
*   Using MD&A implied days: FY24: 77.6 - 54.5 = **23.1 days**; FY23: 58.9 - 51.4 = **7.5 days**
*   *The cash conversion cycle has elongated, primarily due to a larger increase in DSO compared to DPO.*

### Capex Analysis (Consolidated)

*   Total Capex (Purchase of PPE, CWIP, Intangibles, IAUD):
    *   FY24: 49.66 (PPE) + 66.95 (IAUD) = **116.61 INR Million**
    *   FY23: 41.75 (PPE) + 11.71 (IAUD) + 11.78 (Investment Property) = **65.24 INR Million**
*   The company operates in a single reportable segment: "providing benefit management services through a proprietary technology platform".
*   Therefore, a capex analysis by distinct business segment is not applicable. Capex is primarily towards technology platform development (intangibles under development, software) and operational infrastructure.

## Financial Analysis Report: Dreamfolks Services Ltd. (FY24)

### Executive Summary

Dreamfolks Services Ltd. reported strong revenue growth in FY24, driven by increased passenger volumes and strategic expansion of its service portfolio beyond airport lounges. Revenue from operations surged 47% YoY to INR 11,350 million. However, profitability faced pressure, with Profit After Tax (PAT) declining to INR 686 million from INR 725 million in FY23, attributed to higher cost of services. Gross margins remained stable at 12.1%, within guidance, while adjusted EBITDA stood at INR 1,033 million (9.1% margin). The company is actively diversifying its offerings (e.g., railways, lifestyle services) and expanding geographically, aiming to increase revenue from non-Indian airport lounge services, which grew to 6% of total revenue. Technological advancements, strategic partnerships, and a focus on enhancing customer experience are central to its growth strategy. Key challenges include managing cost of services, market competition, and dependencies on the travel ecosystem.

### Financial Performance Analysis

#### Revenue Analysis

*   **Overall Growth:** Consolidated revenue from operations increased by 46.8% to INR 11,350 million in FY24 from INR 7,733 million in FY23. This significantly outpaced the domestic air traffic growth of 13%, indicating market share gains and successful monetization of increased passenger footfall (~11 million PAX facilitated in FY24 vs. 3.5 million in FY22). The revenue CAGR from FY22 to FY24 was a robust 100%.
*   **Diversification Impact:** Revenue from services beyond Indian airport lounges grew to 6% of total revenue in FY24, up from less than 2% in FY22. The company targets this segment to contribute 15-20% in the next 4-5 years, signaling a strategic shift and potential new growth avenues.

#### Profitability Analysis

*   **Gross Profit:** Gross margins were maintained at 12.1% in FY24, consistent with company guidance.
*   **EBITDA:** Adjusted EBITDA reached INR 1,033 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.1%. The CAGR for Adjusted EBITDA (FY22-FY24) was 102%.
*   **Profit Before Tax (PBT):**
    *   Consolidated PBT: Decreased to INR 924.53 million in FY24 from INR 974.35 million in FY23.
    *   Standalone PBT: Decreased to INR 923.29 million in FY24 from INR 974.16 million in FY23.
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT):**
    *   Consolidated PAT: Decreased to INR 686.37 million in FY24 from INR 725.27 million in FY23.
    *   Standalone PAT: Decreased to INR 685.99 million in FY24 from INR 725.10 million in FY23.
*   **Margin Contraction:** Net Profit Margin (Standalone) declined to 6.0% in FY24 from 9.4% in FY23. This is attributed by management primarily to "High costs of services during FY2024" offsetting revenue growth. This indicates potential pressures from suppliers/lounge operators or increased costs associated with diversification and expansion. The long-term PAT CAGR (FY22-FY24) of 105.5% contrasts with the recent YoY decline.

#### Key Financial Ratios (Standalone FY24 vs FY23)

*   **Return on Equity (RoE):** Decreased to 34.9% in FY24 from 60.6% in FY23, primarily due to lower profit relative to an increased net worth.
*   **Return on Capital Employed (RoCE):** Stood at 38.1% in FY24 (Standalone). Consolidated RoCE was 39.99% in FY24, down from 62.65% in FY23, reflecting the profitability pressure.
*   **Debt-Equity Ratio:** Improved (decreased) significantly, indicating a stronger balance sheet or lower reliance on debt relative to equity.
*   **Current Ratio:** Improved from 1.51 to 1.80 (Standalone), suggesting better short-term liquidity.
*   **Debtors Turnover Ratio:** Remained relatively stable.
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Remained robust, indicating sufficient ability to cover interest payments.

#### Cash Flow

*   The standalone cash flow statement indicates net cash generated from operating activities was INR 109.39 million in FY24, a decrease from INR 604.25 million in FY23. This was primarily driven by a smaller increase in trade payables and other financial liabilities compared to the previous year, and a larger increase in trade receivables and other financial assets.
*   Cash flow from investing activities showed a net outflow, largely due to investments in debt funds and purchase of intangible assets.
*   Cash flow from financing activities included proceeds from ESOPs and dividend payments.

### Operational and Strategic Analysis

#### Market Position & Industry Dynamics

*   Dreamfolks holds a dominant market share: 95% of all card-based lounge access and 68% of overall lounge access in India. It maintains 100% coverage across airport and railway lounges in India.
*   Industry tailwinds include rising disposable incomes, a growing middle class, increased credit card penetration (19% YoY growth in cards, 7% YoY growth in avg. spend/card), a surge in business travel, and growing demand for luxury travel. India is poised to be the third-largest aviation market by 2025.

#### Service Portfolio Expansion & Diversification

*   **Core Business Extension:** Expanding beyond airport lounges to railway stations, highways, and visa application centers.
*   **New Service Verticals:** Actively adding new services such as global luxury experiences (RedBeryl), airport transfers (Eco Mobility), beauty & grooming (Looks Salon), E-sim solutions (Matrix), floral & gifting (MyFlowerTree), healthcare (Healthians), golf services (via Golfklik acquisition), and visa services. This strategy aims to create multiple touchpoints throughout the travel and lifestyle journey.

#### Geographical Expansion

*   Entered the Malaysian market.
