## Overview
### Comprehensive Analysis


This analysis dissects Apollo Tyres Ltd.'s Annual Report for FY24, covering financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

FY24 showcased robust financial performance despite macroeconomic headwinds.  Key highlights include:

* **Consolidated Revenue from Operations:** ₹253.78 Billion (₹245.68 Billion in FY23), a 3.3% increase.  This growth was driven by improved efficiency, a stronger sales mix, and timely pricing actions.
* **Consolidated Operating Profit (EBITDA):** ₹44.47 Billion (₹33.14 Billion in FY23), a significant 34% surge.
* **Consolidated Net Profit:** ₹17.22 Billion (₹10.46 Billion in FY23), a remarkable 65% increase, translating to a net profit margin of 6.8% (a 253 basis point year-on-year increase).
* **Free Cash Flow:** A substantial increase from ₹6 Billion to ₹20 Billion.
* **Net Debt Reduction:**  Significant reduction in net debt from ₹43 Billion to ₹25 Billion, strengthening the balance sheet.
* **Improved Margins:** EBITDA margin reached 17%, exceeding the FY26 target of 15%, while Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) reached 16%, surpassing the target range of 12-15%.  Net Debt/EBITDA ratio improved to 0.6x, well below the target of less than 2x.

**II. Business Segments:**

Apollo Tyres operates in several segments, each exhibiting varied performance:

* **Passenger Car Radial (PCR) Tyres:** Maintained market leadership in the Indian replacement market for the fourth consecutive year, with strong OEM partnerships and a growing premium sales mix (36% in FY24 vs. 27% in FY23).  The launch of Apollo Amperion EV tyres secured significant OEM fitments.
* **Commercial Vehicle (CV) Tyres:** Showed good growth, driven by new product launches (Endurace RA, Endutrax MD+) and partnerships focused on fuel efficiency.  The Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) segment demonstrated particularly strong performance.
* **Off-Highway Tyres (OHT):**  Experienced a rebound in H2 FY24, driven by new products and stronger market positioning, particularly in the agricultural segment (VIRAT, Krishak Gold X).  The Industrial segment also showed double-digit growth.

* **Europe:**  The European operations showed growth fueled by the expansion of the product portfolio, especially in All-Season, Winter, and Light Truck segments.  Significant OEM wins were secured, showcasing the strength of the Vredestein brand.
* **Americas:**  Marked the entry of the Vredestein brand in Canada and the Apollo brand in the US commercial vehicle segment.

**III. Risks and Concerns:**

The report acknowledges several significant risks and opportunities:

* **Economic Downturn:**  A potential slowdown in key markets (India and Europe) poses a threat to demand and capacity utilization.
* **Raw Material Price Volatility:** Fluctuations in raw material costs (natural rubber, crude oil derivatives) impact profitability and the ability to pass on price increases to customers.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Geopolitical instability and other unforeseen events can disrupt the supply chain and increase transportation costs.
* **Intense Competition:**  The competitive landscape necessitates continuous product innovation and market share defense.
* **Manpower and Labor:**  Attracting and retaining skilled labor is crucial for operational efficiency.

* **Changing Market Trends:** Rapidly evolving consumer preferences and regulatory landscape necessitates adaptability and innovation, particularly in the growing electric vehicle (EV) segment.

**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

Apollo Tyres demonstrates a strong commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles.  Key initiatives include:

* **Climate Change:**  Committed to Net Zero emissions by 2050, with targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 25% and 35%, respectively, by FY26. Initiatives include increased renewable energy usage (22.7% renewable electricity share in FY24), energy efficiency improvements, and exploring alternate fuels (biomass).
* **Water Conservation:**  Significant reduction in water withdrawal intensity (24.43% decrease compared to FY19), achieved through various initiatives like wastewater recycling and rainwater harvesting.  Chennai plant received ISO 46001:2019 certification for water management.
* **Waste Management:**  Focus on the 6Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Replace, Redesign, and Reliability) to minimize waste sent to landfills.  Significant waste recycling rates were achieved.
* **Circular Economy:**  Commitment to using 40% renewable/recycled input materials by 2030, with progress made in incorporating recycled rubber and exploring bio-based materials.
* **Biodiversity:**  Various initiatives for mangrove conservation, afforestation (Miyawaki and teak plantations), and pond restoration, benefitting numerous communities.
* **Social Responsibility:**  Focus on employee well-being (Great Place to Work certification, Top Employer certifications), diversity and inclusion initiatives, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs focusing on healthcare for truckers, sanitation, women's empowerment, and biodiversity conservation.  Significant impact in the communities where Apollo Tyres operates.
* **Governance:**  Strong governance structure with independent Board members and various committees (Audit, Nomination & Remuneration, Stakeholders Relationship, Risk Management, BRS, CSR) ensuring transparency, accountability, and ethical business conduct.  Double Materiality Assessment conducted to identify and prioritize key ESG topics.
* **Supply Chain Sustainability:**  Sustainable procurement policies (ATSPP, ASNRP) and regular supplier assessments to promote ethical and environmental best practices across its value chain.  Significant progress in terms of number of suppliers adopting the ATSPP.

**V. Overall Assessment:**

Apollo Tyres delivered a strong financial performance in FY24, exceeding several long-term targets.  The company's dual-brand strategy (Apollo and Vredestein), geographical diversification, and focus on premiumization are driving growth.  The commitment to sustainability and ESG is commendable and clearly integrated into the business strategy. However, the company faces challenges related to macroeconomic uncertainties, raw material price volatility, and intense competition.  The success of its long-term strategy will depend on its ability to navigate these risks effectively while continuing to invest in innovation and sustainability.  The significant expansion in the Americas market is a considerable opportunity for future growth.

These significantly contribute to the total equity value.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
The annual report provides both standalone and consolidated figures. Here's a summary of the requested values:

**A. Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹175,393.30 Million
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹144,427.21 Million (This includes cost of materials consumed, purchase of stock-in-trade, changes in inventories, and the portion of manufacturing overheads allocated to cost of goods sold)
* **Gross Profit:** ₹30,966.09 Million (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)
* **Operating Expenses:** ₹11,461.18 Million  (This represents the sum of employee benefits expense, finance costs, depreciation & amortization expense, and other expenses)
* **Operating Income (EBITDA excluding other income):** ₹30,966.09 Million (The report presents this value directly. It should be noted that other operating income is explicitly excluded from this calculation.)


**B. Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹253,777.15 Million

**Important Note:** All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest million.  Always refer to the original financial statements for the precise, unrounded values.  There may be minor discrepancies depending on how specific line items are classified within the report.  For example, some expenses might be categorized differently between standalone and consolidated reports.  Also note that the report explicitly presents EBITDA (excluding other income), which is used here as the operating income.  A different measure of operating income might result from a different calculation.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Here's a summary of the net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS values from both the standalone and consolidated financial statements presented in Apollo Tyres Ltd.'s Annual Report:


**A. Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income (Profit After Tax):** ₹11,540.25 Million
* **EBITDA (Operating Profit excluding other income):** ₹30,966.09 Million
* **Basic EPS:** ₹18.17
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹18.17


**B. Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income (Profit After Tax):** ₹17,218.66 Million
* **EBITDA (Operating Profit excluding other income):** ₹44,473.45 Million
* **Basic EPS:** ₹27.11
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹27.11


**Important Note:** All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest million or two decimal places for EPS, as presented in the financial statements.  Refer to the original financial statements for the precise, unrounded numbers.  Remember that "other income" is excluded from the EBITDA calculation.


### Cash Flow Components
The cash flow statement is also presented on both a standalone and consolidated basis. Here's a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows from Apollo Tyres' FY24 annual report:

**A. Standalone Cash Flow Statement:**

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹20,853.78 Million
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(2,339.00) Million (Note that this figure represents net cash *used* in investing activities, indicating a net outflow.)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹(16,560.72) Million (Note that this figure represents net cash *used* in financing activities, indicating a net outflow.)


**B. Consolidated Cash Flow Statement:**

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹34,395.24 Million
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(4,784.19) Million (Net cash used in investing activities)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹(26,590.60) Million (Net cash used in financing activities)


**Important Note:** All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest million, as presented in the financial statements. Always consult the original financial statements for the most accurate, unrounded numbers.  The negative signs indicate net cash outflows for investing and financing activities.  The classifications and detailed line items within these categories may also vary slightly between the standalone and consolidated statements.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The annual report does not explicitly state the free cash flow figure.  However, we can calculate it and also extract the capital expenditure and dividend paid amounts.  Remember that different methods for calculating free cash flow exist, leading to slightly different results. Here's what we can determine based on the information provided:


**Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF):**

A common method for calculating FCF is:

FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures

**A. Standalone:**

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹20,853.78 Million (from the Standalone Cash Flow Statement)
* **Capital Expenditures (CAPEX):**  This information is not directly provided in the standalone financial statements but is mentioned in other parts of the report.  It would need to be sourced from a different section of the report not included in this prompt.  Therefore, a precise standalone FCF calculation cannot be performed here.
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹2,857.95 Million (from the Standalone Cash Flow Statement)


**B. Consolidated:**

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹34,395.24 Million (from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement)
* **Capital Expenditures (CAPEX):**  As in the standalone case, this figure is not explicitly available in this part of the consolidated financial statements. It would require information from another section of the report not included in this prompt. A precise consolidated FCF calculation cannot be performed here.
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹2,857.95 Million (This value, while presented in the standalone cash flow statement, represents the total dividends paid by the *parent* company. For a truly consolidated view of dividends, data for dividends paid by *all* subsidiaries would also be needed)


**Without the CAPEX figures, a precise FCF cannot be calculated.**  The report provides significant details on capital investment in various areas in the Management Discussion and Analysis section but not a single consolidated number for CAPEX in the financial statements themselves.  You'll need to locate that data within the full annual report to complete the FCF calculation.



## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
Profitability ratios can be calculated using the values from the income statement and balance sheet. The annual report presents some profitability ratios, but not all of them. Here's a calculation of the ratios you requested, using the rounded figures from the financial statements (standalone and consolidated):  Keep in mind that using the rounded values results in slightly less precise ratios than would be obtained using the full, unrounded figures.


**A. Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹175,393.30 Million
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹144,427.21 Million
* **Gross Profit:** ₹30,966.09 Million
* **Profit After Tax:** ₹11,540.25 Million
* **Average Shareholder Equity:** (₹96,003.19 Million + ₹104,394.24 Million) / 2 = ₹100,198.72 Million
* **Average Total Assets:** (₹201,084.50 Million + ₹200,439.01 Million) / 2 = ₹200,761.76 Million


* **Gross Profit Margin:** (₹30,966.09 Million / ₹175,393.30 Million) * 100% = 17.66%
* **Operating Margin (EBITDA Margin):** (₹30,966.09 Million / ₹175,393.30 Million) * 100% = 17.66% (Note: The report provides this value directly)
* **Net Profit Margin:** (₹11,540.25 Million / ₹175,393.30 Million) * 100% = 6.58%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (₹11,540.25 Million / ₹100,198.72 Million) * 100% = 11.52%
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (₹11,540.25 Million / ₹200,761.76 Million) * 100% = 5.75%


**B. Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹253,777.15 Million
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹229,141.41 Million
* **Gross Profit:** ₹24,635.74 Million
* **Profit After Tax:** ₹17,218.66 Million
* **Average Shareholder Equity:** (₹125,781.99 Million + ₹139,021.85 Million) / 2 = ₹132,401.92 Million
* **Average Total Assets:** (₹273,530.16 Million + ₹269,573.48 Million) / 2 = ₹271,551.82 Million


* **Gross Profit Margin:** (₹24,635.74 Million / ₹253,777.15 Million) * 100% = 9.71%
* **Operating Margin (EBITDA Margin):** (₹44,473.45 Million / ₹253,777.15 Million) * 100% = 17.52% (Note: The report provides this value directly)
* **Net Profit Margin:** (₹17,218.66 Million / ₹253,777.15 Million) * 100% = 6.80%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (₹17,218.66 Million / ₹132,401.92 Million) * 100% = 13.00%
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (₹17,218.66 Million / ₹271,551.82 Million) * 100% = 6.34%


**Important Note:**  These calculations use rounded figures from the financial statements.  The actual, unrounded values will produce slightly different results.  The report itself presents some of these ratios (EBITDA margin), which may differ slightly from these calculations due to rounding differences.  The report also does not explicitly calculate ROA.  Therefore, this calculation uses average total assets to get an approximated result.  Always refer to the original report for the most accurate information.

### Liquidity Ratios
Here's a calculation of the liquidity ratios using the rounded figures from Apollo Tyres' FY24 annual report, for both standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Remember that using rounded numbers will result in slightly less precise ratios than using the full, unrounded figures directly from the report.


**A. Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Current Assets:** ₹56,894 Million
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹50,170.82 Million
* **Quick Assets:** ₹56,894 Million - ₹23,227.34 Million (Inventory) = ₹33,666.66 Million
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹4,941.90 Million


* **Current Ratio:** ₹56,894 Million / ₹50,170.82 Million = 1.13
* **Quick Ratio:** ₹33,666.66 Million / ₹50,170.82 Million = 0.67
* **Cash Ratio:** ₹4,941.90 Million / ₹50,170.82 Million = 0.10


**B. Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Current Assets:** ₹88,476.63 Million
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹70,438.23 Million
* **Quick Assets:** ₹88,476.63 Million - ₹42,457.26 Million (Inventory) = ₹46,019.37 Million
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹9,115.58 Million


* **Current Ratio:** ₹88,476.63 Million / ₹70,438.23 Million = 1.26
* **Quick Ratio:** ₹46,019.37 Million / ₹70,438.23 Million = 0.65
* **Cash Ratio:** ₹9,115.58 Million / ₹70,438.23 Million = 0.13


**Important Note:** These calculations are based on rounded values from the financial statements. The precise, unrounded values from the report will produce slightly different results.  Also, the calculation of quick assets excludes inventories, as these are not considered to be readily convertible to cash.  Always consult the original financial statements for the most accurate data and precise ratio calculations.


### Efficiency Ratios
The annual report does not directly provide all the efficiency ratios you've requested. We can calculate some of them using the available data.  Remember that using rounded figures will lead to slightly less precise results than calculations using the full, unrounded numbers from the original financial statements.

Let's make the following calculations using data from the standalone and consolidated financial statements respectively, keeping in mind that certain ratios (like inventory turnover) require average values over the year, which are not explicitly provided in this report:


**A. Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹175,393.30 Million
* **Average Total Assets:** (₹201,084.50 Million + ₹200,439.01 Million) / 2 = ₹200,761.76 Million
* **Average Inventory:** This value is not directly provided and would need to be calculated from the beginning and ending inventory values across different financial reports, which is not currently available.
* **Average Accounts Receivable:** This value is not directly provided and requires values from different financial statements not currently included.

* **Asset Turnover:** ₹175,393.30 Million / ₹200,761.76 Million = 0.87
* **Inventory Turnover:** Cannot be precisely calculated without the average inventory value.
* **Receivables Turnover:** Cannot be precisely calculated without the average accounts receivable value.


**B. Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹253,777.15 Million
* **Average Total Assets:** (₹273,530.16 Million + ₹269,573.48 Million) / 2 = ₹271,551.82 Million
* **Average Inventory:**  This is not directly provided and would require data from different reports not currently available.
* **Average Accounts Receivable:** This is not directly provided and would require data from different reports not currently available.

* **Asset Turnover:** ₹253,777.15 Million / ₹271,551.82 Million = 0.93
* **Inventory Turnover:** Cannot be precisely calculated without the average inventory value.
* **Receivables Turnover:** Cannot be precisely calculated without the average accounts receivable value.


**Important Note:**  These calculations use rounded figures, resulting in approximate results. The precise values obtained from calculations using unrounded numbers directly from the full financial statements will be slightly different.  Furthermore,  the missing average inventory and accounts receivable values prevent the calculation of the inventory and receivables turnover ratios, highlighting the need to consult the complete financial statements to calculate these additional metrics.



### Leverage Ratios
Here's a calculation of the leverage ratios using rounded figures from Apollo Tyres' FY24 annual report for both standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Remember that using rounded values will yield slightly less precise results than calculations using the full, unrounded figures directly from the report.

**A. Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Total Debt:** ₹45,873.95 Million (Non-Current Liabilities - Borrowings) + ₹7,333.51 Million (Current Liabilities - Borrowings) = ₹53,207.46 Million
* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹104,394.24 Million
* **Total Assets:** ₹200,439.01 Million
* **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT):** ₹19,124.10 Million + ₹4,034.92 Million (Finance Costs) = ₹23,159.02 Million (Note: this calculation uses the values for profit before tax, adding back finance costs to get EBIT.  In practice, different reporting schemes may calculate EBIT differently.)
* **Interest Expense:** ₹4,034.92 Million


* **Debt to Equity Ratio:** ₹53,207.46 Million / ₹104,394.24 Million = 0.51
* **Debt to Assets Ratio:** ₹53,207.46 Million / ₹200,439.01 Million = 0.27
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** ₹23,159.02 Million / ₹4,034.92 Million = 5.73


**B. Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Total Debt:** ₹26,727.49 Million (Non-Current Liabilities - Borrowings) + ₹12,691.12 Million (Current Liabilities - Borrowings) = ₹39,418.61 Million
* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹139,021.85 Million
* **Total Assets:** ₹269,573.48 Million
* **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT):** ₹26,175.08 Million + ₹5,059.41 Million (Finance Costs) = ₹31,234.49 Million (Note: this calculation uses the values for profit before tax, adding back finance costs to get EBIT.  In practice, different reporting schemes may calculate EBIT differently.)
* **Interest Expense:** ₹5,059.41 Million


* **Debt to Equity Ratio:** ₹39,418.61 Million / ₹139,021.85 Million = 0.28
* **Debt to Assets Ratio:** ₹39,418.61 Million / ₹269,573.48 Million = 0.15
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** ₹31,234.49 Million / ₹5,059.41 Million = 6.17


**Important Note:**  These calculations use rounded numbers from the financial statements and will produce slightly different results from calculations using the full, unrounded figures from the original report.  Also, the calculation of EBIT adds back finance costs to profit before tax.  In practice, EBIT might be calculated differently depending on reporting conventions.  Always refer to the original financial statements for the most precise data and detailed calculations.  Furthermore, lease liabilities are not explicitly included in the total debt calculation, although they represent a form of debt.  Including lease liabilities in total debt would increase the debt ratios.





## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The annual report provides some of this information, but not all of it.  To calculate some of these ratios, we will need to make certain assumptions, given that not all necessary figures are directly provided within the provided text. Let's proceed using the available data, keeping in mind that any resulting ratios will be approximations:


**A. Values directly from the report (standalone and consolidated):**

* **Market Capitalization:**  The report provides the market capitalization as of March 31, 2024, separately for both NSE and BSE: ₹296,084.06 Million (NSE) and ₹296,242.84 Million (BSE).  These values are very close, and we can take an average for a reasonable approximation.

* **Dividends Paid (Standalone):** ₹2,857.95 Million
* **Net Income (Standalone):** ₹11,540.25 Million
* **Net Income (Consolidated):** ₹17,218.66 Million

**B. Values requiring assumptions or calculations:**

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):** To calculate the PE ratio, we need the market capitalization and the net income. We also need the share price. The report gives a closing share price but not a specific average price which would ideally be used for PE calculations. Therefore, we will use the closing share price.

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):**  To calculate the PB ratio, we need the market capitalization and the book value of equity. The report gives the book value of equity (shareholders' equity), but we don't have a precisely defined average share price.  Again, we will use the closing share price.

* **Dividend Yield:**  This requires the annual dividend per share and the share price. The report states the recommended dividend per share (₹6.00), but doesn't provide a specific average share price for the year. We will again use the closing price.

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** This can be calculated using the total dividends paid and the net income. We'll use standalone figures, keeping in mind that a fully consolidated view would require data not readily available here (dividends paid by all subsidiaries):


Let's calculate using the available data with the specified assumptions:

**Assumptions:**

* **Average Share Price:** We will use the closing share price from March 31st, 2024 (₹466.33 approx. — this is an average between the closing prices on the NSE and BSE).


**Calculations (Approximate):**

**II. Mitigation Strategies & Trends:**

Apollo Tyres employs several mitigation strategies to address these risks, such as diversification, hedging, robust  inventory  management,  and  investment  in  technology  and  R&D. The  Company acknowledges  that  many  of  these  risks (especially  those  related  to  global  economic  conditions and  geopolitical  events)  are  difficult  to  predict  and control with complete certainty.  Many of the identified trends indicate the continued presence of these risks into the foreseeable future.  The focus remains on enhancing operational efficiency, maintaining a strong financial position, and adapting to changing market dynamics.  A proactive approach to risk management is highlighted by the Company as a key priority.


**III.  Limitations:**

This analysis provides a qualitative assessment.  A more precise quantitative analysis of likelihood and severity would require additional data and a more in-depth risk assessment methodology beyond the scope of this annual report summary.  The interdependencies between the different risk factors also are not fully addressed here.

**B. Employee Count:**

The report provides a detailed breakdown of the employee count by various categories (gender, contract type, etc.).  However, a single overall figure is not explicitly stated. To determine the total workforce, you'd need to sum up the different categories.  This would be significantly simplified by access to the full annual report tables which contain this data.  It would also be possible to access a single precise figure by searching for terms such as "total workforce" or "total employees" in the full annual report.

Here's what is available from the report:

* **Standalone Permanent Employees:** 2,315
* **Standalone Non-Permanent Employees:** 39
* **Standalone Permanent Workers:** 5,244
* **Standalone Non-Permanent Workers:** 7,859
* **Consolidated Employee Count (approximation):**  To obtain a truly precise consolidated figure, you must sum up all the employee categories across all subsidiaries, based on the data in the full annual report.


**Important Note:** The figures for R&D expenditure are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest million.  The numbers for employee counts are not summarized in a single figure and require addition of individual categories to obtain a consolidated number for the total number of employees. Always consult the original annual report for precise, unrounded figures.
