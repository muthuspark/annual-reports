## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis looks into Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Integrated Annual Report for FY2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, identified risks, and ESG initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

FY2023-24 marked a year of robust performance amidst global economic uncertainty.  Key financial highlights (Consolidated):

* **Revenue from Operations:** ₹7,312.81 Crore (10% YoY growth)
* **EBITDA:** ₹713.69 Crore (3% YoY growth)
* **Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹441.78 Crore (3% YoY growth)
* **EPS (Basic):** ₹6.88
* **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** 26.78%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 15.43%
* **Dividend:** 150% (₹3 per share)

While absolute profit growth was modest (3%), the report highlights a significant strategic shift towards "profit-led growth" under the Crompton 2.0 strategy.  This involved increased investment in brand building, R&D, and talent development, laying the groundwork for accelerated future growth.

**Key Financial Metrics (Standalone):**  The standalone financial statements reflect similar trends but with slightly higher margins compared to consolidated figures.

* **Revenue from Operations:** ₹6,388.38 Crore
* **PAT:** ₹466.45 Crore
* **Return on Net Worth (RoNW):** 15.43% (lower YoY due to increased shareholder funds)

Several key financial ratios are provided in the MDA, including debtor turnover, inventory turnover, interest coverage, current ratio, and debt-equity ratio. These ratios indicate a healthy financial position with improved use and interest coverage, though some ratios (like RoNW) show slight year-on-year decline.  The report attributes this to increased investment in growth initiatives.

**II. Business Segments:**

Crompton operates in many interconnected business segments:

* **Electrical Consumer Durables (ECD):** This segment experienced industry-leading growth (17% YoY), driven by strong performance in fans, pumps, and small domestic appliances.  The report emphasizes a successful premiumization strategy within this segment.
    * **Fans:** Crompton is the market leader, with significant growth in premium and decorative segments.  New product launches focused on BLDC technology and energy efficiency.
    * **Pumps:** Strong growth in agricultural and residential segments, expansion into solar pumps (PM KUSUM scheme), and introduction of durable models.
    * **Large Domestic Appliances (LDA):** Growth driven by premiumization and portfolio expansion in water heaters and air coolers.
    * **Small Domestic Appliances (SDA):** Significant growth, especially online, in mixer grinders, and expansion into other small kitchen appliances.


* **Large Kitchen Appliances:** This segment showcased exceptional growth (2.3x YoY revenue increase) in built-in kitchen appliances (chimneys, ovens, hobs), fuelled by strategic expansion of Point of Sales (POS) and innovative product launches.

* **Lighting:** This segment faced challenges due to price erosion in B2C, but B2B experienced growth due to infrastructure projects.  The report highlights a renewed focus on portfolio expansion and GTM strategies for future growth.  B2C focused on premium lighting and outdoor solutions.  B2B secured major infrastructure projects.

* **Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances Limited:** This subsidiary, acquired by Crompton, contributes significantly to the kitchen appliances sector, especially in South India. It faced challenges in the corporate channel but showed resilience in retail and e-commerce.


**III. Risks:**

The annual report identifies many key risks:

* **Economic Risks:**  Macroeconomic uncertainties, volatile commodity prices, and potential slowdown in consumer spending.  Mitigation strategies involve cost optimization, diversification, and robust supply chain management.
* **Product Risks:** Competition, product quality issues, and regulatory changes (BEE and BIS norms).  Mitigation involves rigorous quality control, continuous improvement initiatives, and proactive compliance with regulations.
* **Brand Risks:**  Negative consumer feedback, service quality issues, and counterfeit products.  Mitigation focuses on enhanced customer service, robust social media monitoring, and legal action against counterfeiting.
* **Supply Chain Risks:**  Disruptions, dependency on single sources, and geopolitical uncertainties.  Mitigation emphasizes diversification of sourcing, development of alternate suppliers, and strategic vendor partnerships.
* **People Risks:**  Employee attrition, talent management, and succession planning.  Mitigation is being addressed through enhanced employee engagement programs, structured talent development initiatives, and robust leadership development programs.
* **IT Risks:** Cyber and information security threats, and the growing need to comply with data protection laws.  Mitigation involves continuous investment in cybersecurity infrastructure, employee training, and strict data governance.


**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

Crompton's ESG performance is a major focus of the report.  Key highlights include:

* **Energy Efficiency:** Significant improvements in energy efficiency across products (fans, water heaters, lighting) resulting in a 17.6% reduction in emissions (manufacturing facilities).  The report showcases specific examples of technological advancements that drive energy savings.
* **Water Management:**  Implementation of zero liquid discharge systems in manufacturing facilities and a reduction in water consumption.  Water recycling is highlighted as a key achievement.
* **Waste Management:** Initiatives to minimize waste generation, improve waste segregation, increase recycling and reuse rates. The Company achieved 100% compliance with CPCB plastic waste targets.  Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) compliance is also emphasized.
* **Occupational Health and Safety:**  Zero Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) in FY2023-24 reflects the Company's commitment to workplace safety. Various safety programs, regular audits, and training initiatives are described.
* **Community Engagement:**  CSR initiatives focus on water conservation, skill development, community care, and employee engagement.  Projects implemented with social impact organizations are detailed, highlighting the number of lives impacted.

The report also introduces an ESG dashboard for better data management and tracking of key sustainability indicators. The Company engaged BDO India LLP to provide independent assurance for BRSR core indicators and limited assurance for non-financial disclosures, enhancing transparency and accountability.


**Overall Conclusion:**

Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 showcases a year of solid financial performance and notable progress on ESG initiatives. The Crompton 2.0 strategy, the emphasis on premiumization, and the investment in sustainability and talent management are positioning the company for future growth. While certain challenges remain (particularly in the lighting segment and some financial ratios), the report presents a positive outlook, emphasizing the Company's commitment to sustainability, innovation, and stakeholder value creation.  However,  the  relatively  limited  disclosure  on  Scope 3 emissions and the lack of details on LCA require further exploration to fully understand the Company's complete sustainability footprint.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
The values for total assets, current assets, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (trade receivables), and inventory, as reported in Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, are:

* **Total Assets:** ₹5,574.48 Crore
* **Current Assets:** ₹2,305.90 Crore
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹130.79 Crore
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** ₹580.12 Crore (current) + ₹12.65 Crore (non-current) = ₹592.77 Crore
* **Inventory:** ₹698.00 Crore

It is important to note that these are the figures from the *standalone* financial statements. The consolidated financial statements would include the figures for subsidiary companies, resulting in different totals.

### Liability Analysis
Based on Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024:

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹2,369.00 Crore
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹1,814.87 Crore
* **Long-Term Debt:** ₹298.97 Crore  (This represents the portion of long-term debt not due within one year.  The total long-term debt is higher, as evidenced by the redemption of ₹325 Crore in NCDs during the year. The detailed breakdown of debentures is available in Note 12 to the financial statements.)
* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** ₹1,172.45 Crore (current) + ₹14.03 Crore (non-current) = ₹1,186.48 Crore


Remember that these figures are from the standalone financial statements.  The consolidated figures would be different as they include the liabilities of subsidiary companies.

### Equity Analysis
According to Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024:

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹3,205.48 Crore
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹2,638.62 Crore
* **Share Capital:** ₹128.62 Crore

These figures are from the standalone financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements would show different values because they include the equity of subsidiary companies.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Based on Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2024:


* **Revenue from Operations:** ₹6,388.38 Crore
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹5,837.68 Crore (This includes cost of materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade, and changes in inventories.)
* **Gross Profit:** ₹550.70 Crore (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)
* **Operating Expenses:** ₹5,294.95 Crore (This appears to be an error in the report as it is higher than the cost of revenue.  The report's total expenses, including operating and non-operating expenses, are given as ₹5,837.68 Crore. The correct operating expense figure is not directly stated in the report)
* **Operating Income:**  The report does not clearly segregate operating income from profit before exceptional items and tax (₹611.04 crore).  To derive the operating income, one would need a more precise breakdown of expenses which is not directly available.  There is a discrepancy in the statement that needs clarification.


It's essential to remember these numbers are from the standalone financial statements.  Consolidated figures would be higher and reflect the performance of the subsidiary companies.  The discrepancy in the operating expenses needs to be addressed by referring to further clarifying documentation from Crompton or a corrected financial statement.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Using Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2024:

* **Net Income (Profit for the year):** ₹466.45 Crore
* **EBITDA:**  The EBITDA is not explicitly stated in the standalone statement. To calculate it, one would need to add back depreciation and amortization and finance costs to the profit before tax.  This calculation is not possible with just the standalone statement.
* **Basic EPS:** ₹7.29
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹7.29

Note that these figures are from the *standalone* financial statements.  The consolidated statements would show different values as they include the results of subsidiary companies.  Also note that the EBITDA needs further calculation to obtain this metric from the provided data.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
According to Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's Standalone Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024:

* **Cash flow from Operating Activities:** ₹795.97 Crore
* **Cash flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(175.59) Crore (negative, indicating net cash outflow)
* **Cash flow from Financing Activities:** ₹(533.65) Crore (negative, indicating net cash outflow)

These are the *standalone* cash flow figures.  The consolidated statement of cash flows would include cash flows from subsidiary companies, resulting in different amounts.

### Cash Flow Metrics
Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's standalone financial statements do not directly provide a calculation for free cash flow.  Free cash flow is typically calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.   We have the standalone operating cash flow (₹795.97 Crore), but not the precise standalone capital expenditures.  Therefore, a precise free cash flow cannot be determined from the provided data.


From the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:


* **Capital Expenditure:** The precise amount isn't directly given, but is implied within the  "Cash flows from investing activities" section. The outflow from investing activities, including capital expenditure, is ₹175.59 Crore. This includes capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment (₹64.48 Crore), purchase of current investments (₹73.04 Crore), and other outflows. To isolate capital expenditure from other investment activities, one would need a more detailed breakdown of the investing activities.


* **Dividends Paid:** ₹191.90 Crore (This is explicitly stated in the standalone financial statements under appropriations.)


To get a more precise calculation of free cash flow, one needs a more detailed breakdown of the standalone investing cash flows or access to additional financial documents not provided here.



## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
The standalone financial statements for Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024, provide some profitability ratios, but not all those requested.  We need to calculate some.  Here's what we can determine:

* **Gross Profit Margin:**  This is calculated as Gross Profit / Revenue.  Using the standalone figures: (₹550.70 Crore / ₹6,388.38 Crore) * 100% = **8.65%**

* **Operating Margin:** This requires a precise figure for operating income, which isn't explicitly provided in the standalone statements due to an apparent error. The statement shows the profit *before* exceptional items and tax (₹611.04 Crore).  A precise operating margin calculation is therefore not possible without further details clarifying the expense discrepancy.

* **Net Profit Margin:** This is calculated as Net Income / Revenue. Using the standalone figures: (₹466.45 Crore / ₹6,388.38 Crore) * 100% = **7.30%**

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 15.43% (This is explicitly stated in the report.)

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** This requires Net Income and Average Total Assets.  The standalone Net Income is ₹466.45 Crore. To calculate the average total assets, we need the total assets for the beginning and end of the year.  This data is included in the Balance Sheet (₹5,145.68 crore and ₹5,574.48 crore respectively), resulting in an average of ₹5,360.08 Crore.  Therefore, ROA is calculated as: (₹466.45 Crore / ₹5,360.08 Crore) * 100% = **8.70%**


**Important Note:**  These are standalone ratios.  The consolidated financial statements would provide different profitability ratios, incorporating the results of subsidiary companies.  The operating margin calculation is imprecise due to an apparent error in the standalone financial statement, making it advisable to obtain a clarification from Crompton or consult a corrected financial statement.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate these ratios for Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited as of March 31, 2024, we'll use the figures from the standalone financial statements:

* **Current Ratio:** This is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.  Using the standalone figures: ₹2,305.90 Crore / ₹1,814.87 Crore = **1.27**

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** This is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities. Using the standalone figures: (₹2,305.90 Crore - ₹698.00 Crore) / ₹1,814.87 Crore = **0.88**

* **Cash Ratio:** This is calculated as (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities.  Using the standalone figures: ₹130.79 Crore / ₹1,814.87 Crore = **0.07**


These are the standalone liquidity ratios.  The consolidated ratios would differ due to the inclusion of subsidiary company data.  Remember that these ratios offer a snapshot in time and should be interpreted in conjunction with other financial data and industry benchmarks.

### Efficiency Ratios
To calculate these efficiency ratios for Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024, we'll use data from the standalone financial statements. Note that precise calculations require average values for assets and inventory; using year-end values provides an approximation.

* **Asset Turnover:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as Revenue / Average Total Assets.  Using year-end values for approximation: ₹6,388.38 Crore / ₹5,574.48 Crore = **1.15**

* **Inventory Turnover:** This shows how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory during a period.  It's calculated as Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  Using year-end values for approximation: ₹5,837.68 Crore / ₹698.00 Crore = **8.39**

* **Receivables Turnover:** This measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. It's calculated as Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable. Using year-end values for approximation: ₹6,388.38 Crore / ₹592.77 Crore = **10.78**


**Important Considerations:**

* **Average Values:**  The calculations above use year-end values for assets and inventory as approximations. More accurate results would use average values (beginning-of-year + end-of-year) / 2.  The precise beginning-of-year values are not provided in the supplied report, preventing a completely accurate calculation.
* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:** These are standalone ratios. The consolidated ratios, incorporating data from subsidiaries, would differ.
* **Industry Benchmarks:** These ratios should always be compared to industry averages and trends to get a complete understanding of the company's performance relative to its peers.


Therefore, the figures provided above are approximations; more precise calculations require data not readily available in the provided annual report.

### Leverage Ratios
To calculate these use ratios for Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited as of March 31, 2024, we'll use data from the standalone financial statements.  Note that some precision is lost when using year-end values rather than averages.  Also, "total debt" needs clarification because the report doesn't clearly define or separate all debt components. We will use total borrowings as a proxy for total debt.

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** This measures the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt relative to equity. It's calculated as Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity. Using year-end values for total borrowings (₹598.97 Crore): ₹598.97 Crore / ₹3,205.48 Crore = **0.19**

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** This indicates the proportion of a company's assets financed by debt. It's calculated as Total Debt / Total Assets.  Using year-end values for total borrowings: ₹598.97 Crore / ₹5,574.48 Crore = **0.11**

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** This measures a company's ability to pay its interest expenses.  It's calculated as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense. The standalone statement provides the Profit Before Tax (PBT) of ₹611.04 Crore and Interest Expense of ₹72.77 Crore.  We need to add back the interest expense to the PBT to get EBIT which then becomes: (₹611.04 Crore + ₹72.77 Crore) / ₹72.77 Crore = **9.53**


**Important Considerations:**

* **Average Values:**  More precise calculations would use average values for equity and assets (beginning-of-year + end-of-year) / 2.  The precise beginning-of-year values are not available in the provided report.
* **Definition of Debt:** The report uses "borrowings" as a proxy for debt, but it might include other debt components (such as lease liabilities, other payables etc) not explicitly disclosed.  A more complete calculation requires a clearer definition of "total debt".
* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:** These are standalone use ratios. Consolidated ratios would include the debt of subsidiary companies and therefore, would be different.
* **Industry Benchmarks:** These ratios should be compared to industry benchmarks to evaluate the Company's financial risk relative to its peers.

Therefore, the numbers above are reasonable approximations, but more precise calculations require data not readily available in the provided annual report. The definition of total debt needs to be established to calculate this more accurately.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The annual report does not provide the market capitalization, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, or dividend yield directly. These require information from the stock market (share price and number of outstanding shares) that is not included in the annual report itself.

However, we can calculate the **dividend payout ratio** using information from the annual report:


* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** This is calculated as Dividends Paid / Net Income. Using the standalone figures for dividends paid (₹191.90 Crore) and net income (₹466.45 Crore): ₹191.90 Crore / ₹466.45 Crore = **41.14%**

To obtain the other market-based ratios, you will need to obtain the following from a financial data provider like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg:

* **Market Capitalization:**  This is calculated by multiplying the current market price per share by the total number of outstanding shares.
* **Share Price:** The current market price of Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's shares.
* **Number of Outstanding Shares:** The total number of shares currently in circulation.

Once you have the market capitalization and share price, you can calculate:

* **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):** Market Capitalization / Net Income
* **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):** Market Capitalization / Shareholders' Equity
* **Dividend Yield:** (Annual Dividend per Share / Share Price) * 100%

Remember that these market-based ratios are dynamic and change constantly based on market conditions and share price fluctuations.  The dividend payout ratio provided is based on standalone data; the consolidated ratio may differ.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's annual report provides some, but not all, of this detailed segment information.  A precise breakdown requires piecing together information from various sections.  Here's a summary, keeping in mind some data points are approximated or estimated based on available information:

**Notes:**

* **Revenue figures** are estimates based on the overall revenue and segmental discussions, as a precise breakdown isn't provided.
* **Growth rates** are derived from statements within the report, but not all segments specify their growth rates consistently.  Significant growth is often mentioned qualitatively, rather than quantitatively.
* **Operating margins** aren't clearly given for each segment.  The report mentions margin improvements in many segments but avoids explicitly stating the margin percentages.
* **Market share data** is not explicitly provided across all the segments for the year in question and is mostly stated qualitatively.


To obtain a completely precise picture of Crompton's segmental performance, one would need to access supplementary financial documents not provided in this annual report.

5.  **Trend:**  Long-term risk; continuous investment in cybersecurity and data protection is crucial.


**II.  Overall Risk Assessment:**

The report suggests that the management is actively working on mitigating most of these risks. However, given the global economic volatility and the dynamic nature of the consumer durables and technology sector, these risks are likely to remain for the foreseeable future, though the severity and likelihood may vary from year to year. The Company's success will significantly depend on its ability to effectively manage these risks.  The report's lack of a formal risk matrix makes a precise quantification of likelihood and severity challenging.  A more detailed risk assessment would likely need additional detail.

### ESG Ratings
The Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited annual report mentions ESG ratings from many agencies, but not all provide a numerical score.  Here's what's included:

* **MSCI ESG Ratings:** The report states Crompton achieved an "AA" rating from MSCI, indicating strong ESG performance.  However, the specific numerical score isn't given.

* **SES (Sustainalytics):** Crompton's SES Core ESG score is mentioned as 84 out of 100, which is presented in the context of being very high compared to the sector peers.


The report does not provide ratings from other agencies.  To get a complete picture of Crompton's ESG ratings, you would need to consult independent ESG rating providers' websites directly.  They often present different methodologies and therefore, the resulting ratings could also vary.

### ESG Initiatives
Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's annual report highlights various Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, goals, and practices. Here's a summary:


**I. Environmental Initiatives:**

The Company's environmental focus centers on reducing its carbon footprint and promoting sustainability across its operations and product lifecycle. Key initiatives include:

* **Energy Efficiency:** Significant improvements in energy efficiency across product lines (fans, water heaters, lighting) leading to a reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Specific examples of technological improvements in product design are mentioned.
* **Renewable Energy:**  Increased use of renewable energy sources in manufacturing. The report mentions generation of renewable energy but doesn't specify the exact amount or percentage.

* **Overall reduction:** 17.6% reduction from the previous year (manufacturing facilities only).

Scope 3 emissions are not fully quantified in this report. The Company mentions that they plan to analyze Scope 3 emissions in the future.

**III. Social Initiatives (CSR):**

Crompton's CSR initiatives focus on:

* **Water Conservation:** Projects focusing on rainwater harvesting and watershed development impacting a large number of villagers.
* **Skill & Entrepreneurship Development:** Programs aimed at providing vocational training and supporting entrepreneurship among underprivileged youth, especially women, in the communities surrounding the Company's manufacturing facilities.
* **Community Care:**  Initiatives such as building and upgrading school infrastructure, providing scholarships to underprivileged female students,  and establishing a milk bank to support infants.
* **Employee Engagement:**  Employee participation in CSR initiatives, including a "Changemaker Grant" program which allows employees to contribute to community projects.

The report details the number of individuals directly impacted by these initiatives.

**IV. Governance Practices:**

Crompton's corporate governance framework emphasizes:

* **Board Composition and Diversity:** The Board is comprised of Independent and Non-Independent Directors with a stated commitment to diversity and inclusion, including gender diversity. The report emphasizes the different skills and expertise present on the board.
* **Board Committees:** Several Board committees oversee specific aspects of the business, including audit, risk management, nomination & remuneration, corporate social responsibility, stakeholder relations, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.
* **Transparency and Accountability:** Commitment to transparent disclosure of information to stakeholders, including financial and non-financial performance.
* **Ethical Conduct:**  A strong Code of Conduct and a whistle-blower policy are in place to promote ethical behaviour and address concerns.
* **Risk Management:**  A robust risk management framework with specific measures to mitigate identified risks, including financial, operational, and environmental risks.
* **Compliance:**  Adherence to relevant laws and regulations.


**V. Sustainability Goals:**

The  report  doesn't  explicitly  state  long-term,  quantifiable sustainability goals beyond some general statements about energy efficiency and sustainable practices.  While specific initiatives are detailed, targets for the future (e.g., emission reduction targets by a specific date) are not clearly articulated.  The launch of an ESG dashboard suggests a strengthening commitment to data-driven sustainability management but detailed targets are not yet specified.


In summary, Crompton Greaves demonstrates a commitment to ESG through various initiatives and practices, especially in areas of energy efficiency and community engagement.  However, a more robust and detailed disclosure of longer-term, measurable sustainability goals would further strengthen their reporting.  The current reporting emphasizes the 'what' and 'how' of their actions, rather than establishing clear and measurable 'impact' and 'future targets'.

### Audit Information
**Auditor's Opinion:**

The independent auditor, M S K A & Associates, Chartered Accountants, issued an unmodified (clean) opinion on Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited's standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditor found the financial statements to be fairly presented in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The audit report also identified key audit matters related to the assessment of recoverability of investments, goodwill, and provision for warranties.  These key audit matters were addressed in the context of the overall audit.  A similar unmodified opinion was issued for the consolidated financial statements, noting reliance on the work of other auditors for certain subsidiaries.

**Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report details numerous key accounting policies, consistent with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).  Some of the most significant include:

* **Basis of Preparation:** The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis and using a going concern basis of accounting.  Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the company's normal operating cycle (12 months).

* **Basis of Measurement:**  The financial statements are prepared using a historical cost convention, except for financial instruments measured at fair value (through profit or loss or other detailed income), defined benefit liabilities, and share-based payment transactions.

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** Initially recognized at cost, subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets.

* **Intangible Assets:**  Initially recognized at cost.  Amortization is applied over the useful life (or indefinite life, if applicable) using the straight-line method.  Impairment testing is conducted when indicators suggest potential impairment.  Research costs are expensed, while development costs meeting specific criteria are capitalized.

* **Goodwill:**  Recognized at cost less impairment losses, tested annually for impairment using the value-in-use method (discounted cash flow analysis).

* **Inventories:** Measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.

* **Financial Instruments:** Classified into categories (amortized cost, FVOCI, FVTPL) based on business model and cash flow characteristics.  Impairment is assessed for all financial assets except those measured at fair value through profit or loss.  Fair value measurements are categorized within a fair value hierarchy (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3).

* **Leases:**  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for all leases except short-term and low-value leases.  Lease liabilities are measured at present value.

* **Employee Benefits:**  Short-term benefits are measured at undiscounted amounts, while post-employment benefits (defined contribution and defined benefit plans) are measured using actuarial valuations.

* **Revenue Recognition:**  Revenue is recognized using the five-step model of Ind AS 115, based on the transfer of control of goods or services to customers.

* **Income Taxes:**  Both current and deferred taxes are recognized.

* **Borrowing Costs:** Directly attributable borrowing costs are capitalized, while others are expensed.

* **Share-Based Payments:**  Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.

* **Provisions:** Recognized when a present obligation exists, it's probable that an outflow of resources will be required, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

* **Segment Reporting:** The company applies Ind AS 108 to identify and report operating segments.

The complete details of the accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the standalone financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements also follow similar key policies, with adjustments for consolidation.
