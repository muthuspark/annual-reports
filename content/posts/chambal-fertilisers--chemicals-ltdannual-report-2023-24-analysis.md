## Risk Assessment

### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Policy changes can significantly impact profitability, especially concerning urea subsidy.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Government policies in the fertilizer industry are subject to change.
*   **Trend:** Stable, but with potential for volatility. New Investment Policy 2012 is effective for 8 years from the commencement of production.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** The Company is trying to continuously engaging with policymakers and diversifying its product portfolio (Technical Ammonium Nitrate project, Crop Protection, and Speciality Nutrients).
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. Diversification mitigates some risk, but policy dependence remains high.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Substantial, given that 70.81% of standalone revenue in FY2023-24 was from own manufactured fertilizers (primarily urea). Any unfavorable change in policy may put pressure on the revenues and profitability.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium to High. Plant operations and supply chain disruptions can impact production volume.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. The company operates in a high-risk industry.
*   **Trend:** Improving. Urea production increased from 33.47 lakh MT (FY2022-23) to 33.83 lakh MT (FY2023-24).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implemented robust Health, Safety, Security, Environment & Quality Policy. Process safety management system, Behavior Based Safety program. Regular maintenance, safety audits, and drills.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** High, as evidenced by the National Energy Conservation Award 2023, certificate of merit, and reduced accident rate.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Moderate. Production disruptions can lead to lower revenue; energy conservation and safety practices are resulting in cost efficiency.

### Financial Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices, imported fertilizer prices, and currency exchange rates (USD).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Natural gas prices and imported fertilizer prices are volatile. USD/INR exchange rate is also variable.
*   **Trend:** Volatile. Natural gas prices showed less volatility in FY2023-24 compared to FY2022-23.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** For natural gas, a portion is purchased at fixed prices. For imported fertilizers, dynamic sourcing, pricing strategies, and hedging through forward contracts and option structures are used.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. Hedging and fixed-price contracts provide some protection, but external market forces remain a factor.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant impact on costs, profit margins, and the valuation of financial instruments. The Interest Coverage Ratio improved from 5.54 (FY2022-23) to 12.22 (FY2023-24), Debt Equity Ratio improved from 0.47 to 0.25.

### Compliance/Regulatory Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Non-compliance with fertilizer regulations can lead to penalties and reputational damage.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. The company states full compliance with corporate governance requirements and Listing Regulations.
*   **Trend:** Stable. No penalties or strictures were imposed on the Company by stock exchanges or SEBI during the last three years.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Established internal control systems, regular audits, and a Whistle Blower Policy.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** High, as evidenced by the absence of penalties or strictures.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** High in case of major non-compliance, but currently mitigated.

### Emerging Risks: Data Privacy & Cybersecurity Risks

*   **Severity:** High. In the era of digitalization, data privacy and cybersecurity are a high risk.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. More digital interventions are resulting in a higher probability of this risk.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** The company states it has policies.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** No data breach during FY 2023-24.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant, potential fines and reputational damages.
