## Maharashtra Seamless Limited - FY2023-24 Financial Analysis: Operating Performance

### Revenue Analysis

#### Consolidated Revenue Performance

Total Revenue from Operations for FY24: ₹5,404.12 crore, a decrease of 5.46% from ₹5,716.37 crore in FY23. Other Income increased significantly to ₹142.18 crore in FY24 from ₹88.87 crore in FY23. Total Consolidated Income: ₹5,546.30 crore in FY24, down 4.46% from ₹5,805.24 crore in FY23.

#### Segment Revenue (Consolidated - FY24 vs FY23)

##### Steel Pipes & Tubes

*   FY24: ₹5,399.34 crore
*   FY23: ₹5,714.00 crore
*   Growth: -5.51%

This segment remains the primary revenue contributor, accounting for over 99% of operational revenue. The decline mirrors the overall revenue trend. The Chairman's statement indicated robust domestic demand but a slowdown in export markets like the USA and Canada.

##### Power - Electricity

*   FY24: ₹1.68 crore
*   FY23: ₹1.72 crore
*   Growth: -2.33%

This segment has a negligible contribution to overall revenue.

##### RIG

*   FY24: ₹3.10 crore
*   FY23: ₹0.65 crore
*   Growth: +376.92%

While showing significant percentage growth, its absolute contribution to total revenue is minimal.

#### Geographical Revenue Breakdown

The annual report indicates a slowdown in export markets (USA and Canada) but does not provide a detailed quantitative breakdown of revenue by geography. Export incentives were ₹0.98 crore in FY24 (Consolidated) compared to ₹0.61 crore in FY23. Total foreign exchange earned was ₹40.09 Lakh in FY24, suggesting exports are a small fraction of total revenue. Exports contribute less than 10% of total turnover.

#### Major Cost Components as a Percentage of Total Income (₹5,546.30 crore)

*   **Cost of Materials Consumed:** ₹3,249.74 crore (58.59% of Total Income). This is the largest cost component, reflecting the nature of the manufacturing business. Decreased from 64.22% of Total Income in FY23, indicating improved material cost management or changes in product mix/pricing.
*   **Changes in Inventories (Finished Goods, WIP, Stock-in-Trade):** ₹(104.19) crore (-1.88% of Total Income). A negative figure indicates that sales outpaced production leading to a drawdown of inventory, or lower closing inventory valuation.
*   **Employee Benefits Expense:** ₹186.98 crore (3.37% of Total Income). Increased from 2.91% in FY23.
*   **Other Expenses:** ₹860.10 crore (15.51% of Total Income). Slightly increased from 14.82% in FY23.

## Financial Analysis of Maharashtra Seamless Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

#### Standalone Financial Statements

The Independent Auditors, Kanodia Sanyal & Associates, issued an **unmodified opinion**. They stated that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs as of March 31, 2024, and of its profit, cash flows, and changes in equity for the year then ended, in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

The Independent Auditors, Kanodia Sanyal & Associates, issued a **qualified opinion**.

##### Basis for Qualification

The qualification pertains to the financial statements of Gondkhari Coal Mining Limited, a Joint Venture (JV) company. The JV's auditor highlighted that Gondkhari Coal Mining Limited has accumulated losses, its net worth has been fully eroded, and these conditions indicate a material uncertainty casting significant doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern. The JV prepared its statements on a going concern basis despite these uncertainties.

##### Management's Reply

Management stated that necessary provisions regarding the aforesaid qualifications have been recognized in the earlier Standalone statements.

##### Emphasis of Matters & Material Uncertainty

The auditors drew attention to:

*   A subsidiary (not audited by Kanodia Sanyal & Associates) where management assessed a provision for temporary diminution in the value of an investment (USD 95 million) as recovery is less probable, and related loans/advances from shareholders are unlikely to be repaid, with a provision maintained for this.
*   Another subsidiary (not audited by Kanodia Sanyal & Associates) whose accumulated losses and subsequent absorption by shareholders, despite reporting accumulated earnings as of March 31, 2024, may cast significant doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern.

The auditors' opinion on the consolidated financials was not modified in respect of these emphasis of matters.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   **Basis of Preparation:** Financial statements are prepared in accordance with Ind AS on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans measured at fair value.
*   **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when control is transferred to the customer. Interest income is recognized on a time basis using the effective interest rate. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.
*   **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method based on useful lives prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (FIFO for raw materials; weighted average for stores & spares; cost including conversion for WIP/finished goods) or net realizable value. Scrap is valued at NRV.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Recognized at fair value on initial recognition. Subsequent measurement is at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) based on classification criteria.
*   **Impairment of Financial Assets:** Loss allowance is measured at lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) if credit risk has significantly increased, or 12-month ECL otherwise. For trade receivables, lifetime ECL is always applied.
*   **Foreign Currency Transactions:** Transactions are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets/liabilities are re-translated at year-end rates. Differences are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
*   **Consolidation:** Subsidiaries are consolidated line-by-line. Investments in Associates and JVs are accounted for using the equity method.
*   **Changes in Accounting Policies:** The company states, "Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use." No specific major voluntary changes were highlighted for FY 2023-24.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

#### Standalone IFC

The auditors, Kanodia Sanyal & Associates, opined that "the Company has, in all material respect, an adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024." This is an unmodified opinion.

#### Consolidated IFC

The auditors opined that "the Holding Company its subsidiary companies and its joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respect, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March 2024." This opinion is based on their audit and the reports of other auditors for certain subsidiaries and JVs incorporated in India. This is also an unmodified opinion.

#### Directors' Responsibility Statement

Affirms that internal financial controls laid down by the Board are adequate and operating effectively. The Directors' Report also states that the Audit Committee periodically reviews the adequacy of internal financial controls and no reportable material weaknesses were observed during the year.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

#### Secretarial Audit

The Secretarial Audit Report for FY 2023-24, annexed to the Directors' Report, "does not contain any qualification, reservation or adverse remark." However, the Secretarial Auditor noted, "legal compliance mechanism needs to be strengthened and streamlined by the Company to commensurate with its size and operations."

#### SEBI LODR & Companies Act

The Corporate Governance Report states compliance with Regulations 17 to 27 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. The Directors’ Report confirms compliance with applicable Secretarial Standards (SS-1 and SS-2).

#### Penalties/Strictures

The Corporate Governance Report mentions a past fine (FY 2020-21) for delayed submission of financial results, which was subsequently waived by Stock Exchanges. "Except as above, there were no penalties or strictures imposed on the Company by SEBI or any other statutory authorities on any matter related to the capital markets during the last 3 years."

#### Audit Trail

The company has used accounting software with an audit trail (edit log) facility which operated throughout the year, and auditors found no instances of tampering (Note 2.48 to Standalone and Auditors' Report).

### Legal Proceedings and Their Potential Impact

#### Contingent Liabilities

*   Sales Tax Demand under Appeal.
*   Income Tax Demand under Appeal.
*   Excise Duty / GST Demand under Appeal.

The financial statements disclose these as contingent liabilities, implying that management does not consider an outflow of resources to be probable or reliably estimable at this stage.

#### Gondkhari Coal Mining Limited (JV)

The qualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements arises from the material uncertainty regarding the JV's ability to continue as a going concern due to accumulated losses and eroded net worth.

#### Subsidiaries (Emphasis of Matter)

*   Potential impairment of a USD 95 million investment and related shareholder loans in one subsidiary.
*   Going concern uncertainty for another subsidiary due to past accumulated losses, though current accumulated earnings are positive.

### Related Party Transactions

#### Policy and Approval

All related party transactions (RPTs) during the year were stated to be in the ordinary course of business and on an arm's length basis. These transactions were approved by the Audit Committee. The company has a policy on RPTs.

#### Key Audit Matter

The accuracy and completeness of RPT disclosures were identified as a Key Audit Matter by the auditors for both standalone and consolidated financial statements.
