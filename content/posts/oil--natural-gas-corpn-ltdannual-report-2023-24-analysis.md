### Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The use of estimates (e.g., decommissioning costs, reserves, impairment) introduces inherent uncertainty. The reliance on management's technical/commercial evaluations and the use of unaudited statements for some Joint Operations introduces a risk of inaccuracy. The change in accounting policy for scrap material, while prospectively applied due to immateriality, should be noted.

*   **Regulatory Risk:** The Company operates in a highly regulated industry. Disputes with tax and regulatory authorities, as well as ongoing legal proceedings, present potential financial and operational risks. Compliance with environmental regulations and the transition to cleaner energy sources pose both challenges and opportunities. The windfall profit taxes introduced by the Government of India highlight the risk of regulatory changes impacting profitability.
