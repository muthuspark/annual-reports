## Overview
### Detailed Analysis
This annual report for Kovai Medical Center and Hospital Limited (KMCH) for the fiscal year 2023-24 reveals a strong performance driven by growth in both its healthcare services and educational segments.  However, the report also highlights significant risks and a focus on enhancing its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) profile.

**I. Financial Performance:**

* **Revenue Growth:** KMCH experienced robust revenue growth, with total income rising from ₹103.57 crore in 2022-23 to ₹124.05 crore in 2023-24, a 19.59% increase.  This growth is primarily attributed to increased inpatient and outpatient volumes, as well as growth in its educational segment (KMCH Institute of Health Sciences & Research).
* **Profitability:**  Profit after tax (PAT) increased significantly from ₹11.58 crore to ₹17.97 crore, representing a 55% growth.  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) also showed a healthy increase of 27.5% from ₹28.45 crore to ₹36.26 crore. This demonstrates improved operational efficiency and profitability.
* **Dividend:** The board recommended a dividend of ₹10 per share (100%), indicating strong confidence in the company's future prospects.
* **Expenses:** While revenue grew significantly, expenses also increased, especially employee benefits expense (21.95 crore), reflecting the increase in staffing levels following pandemic-related reductions. However, finance costs decreased substantially due to loan prepayment and regular principal payments.  Depreciation also increased due to investments in new equipment.
* **Key Financial Ratios:**  While the annual report provides a table of key financial ratios, it lacks essential context and comparative data.  A proper analysis requires understanding trends over multiple years. The reported ratios (Current Ratio, Debt-Equity Ratio, Debt Service Coverage Ratio) show significant deterioration compared to the previous year, mainly due to increased borrowings and loan repayments. Positive changes are noticed in Return on Equity, Return on Capital Employed, Return on Investment, and Return on Net Worth, indicating improved profitability despite the increased debt.

**II. Business Segments:**

KMCH operates in two primary segments:

* **Healthcare Services:** This is the core business, generating significant revenue through inpatient and outpatient services.  Growth in this segment is driven by increased patient volume across various specialties, especially cardiology, oncology, neurology, and orthopedics.  The introduction of advanced technologies like AI-driven CORI robotic surgery systems and a 3D C-arm further contributes to the growth.
* **Education Services (KMCH Institute of Health Sciences & Research):** This segment is experiencing rapid growth, as reflected by the significant increase in revenue.  The report highlights the high demand for admission to the medical college.

**III. Risks:**

The report identifies many key risks:

* **Capital-Intensive Nature:** KMCH operates in a capital-intensive industry, requiring substantial investments in infrastructure, equipment, and skilled personnel. This can strain cash flow and increase financial risk.
* **Workforce Shortages:**  The scarcity of skilled medical professionals poses a significant challenge in attracting and retaining qualified staff, potentially impacting service quality and operational efficiency.
* **Regulatory Requirements:** Complying with complex and ever-changing healthcare regulations demands significant investments of time and resources, impacting profitability.
* **Rising Costs:** Increasing costs of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and technology put pressure on profitability and affordability for patients.  This also impacts the ability to offer competitive pricing, and attracts new players into the marketplace.
* **Technological and Cybersecurity Risks:**  Protecting sensitive patient data from cyberattacks is a essential concern.


**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

KMCH demonstrates a commitment to ESG principles through various initiatives:

* **Environmental:**  The company has significantly invested in renewable energy sources (solar and wind power), reducing its carbon footprint and energy costs.  It also highlights its efforts in waste management, including the use of zero liquid discharge technology and biogas production.
* **Social:** KMCH showcases its social responsibility through the establishment of an affordable pediatric oncology ward, and a palliative care ward, demonstrating a focus on providing accessible and affordable healthcare to underserved communities.  The report also details numerous initiatives for employee wellbeing, including health insurance and training programs.
* **Governance:** The report details the structure and function of its board committees (Audit, Nomination & Remuneration, Stakeholders Relationship, CSR, Risk Management), emphasizing transparency and accountability.  The company also highlights its compliance with corporate governance norms and regulations.


**V. Overall Assessment:**

KMCH's annual report reveals a company with strong financial performance, significant growth in key areas, and a commitment to both innovation and social responsibility. However, the report needs improvement in many areas:

* **Ratio Analysis:** The report should provide a more thorough analysis of key financial ratios, including trends over many years, industry benchmarks, and explanations of significant variations.
* **Risk Management:** While risks are identified, a more detailed description of the risk mitigation strategies employed is necessary for a detailed understanding of the company's risk management approach.
* **ESG Reporting:**  While ESG initiatives are highlighted, the report could benefit from more detailed and quantified data on environmental performance (e.g., specific emission reductions, waste diversion rates) and social impact (e.g., number of patients served through affordable care programs).  More transparency and data for accountability is needed.

In summary, KMCH demonstrates strong financial growth and a commitment to ESG.  However, a more detailed and transparent presentation of financial and ESG data, along with a detailed discussion of risk management strategies, is needed to provide investors and stakeholders with a complete picture of the company's performance and outlook.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
Based on the provided financial statements:

* **Total Assets:** ₹143.82 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Current Assets:** ₹25.04 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹5.96 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** ₹16.81 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Inventory:** ₹14.70 crore (as of March 31, 2024)


**Important Note:**  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to two decimal places as presented in the report.  The actual values might differ slightly due to rounding differences in the original data.

### Liability Analysis
Based on the provided financial statements:

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹54.97 crore (as of March 31, 2024).  This is calculated by subtracting total equity (₹88.85 crore) from total assets (₹143.82 crore).  Note that this calculation differs slightly from the total equity and liabilities stated at the bottom of the balance sheet likely due to rounding errors within the report itself.

* **Current Liabilities:** ₹20.45 crore (as of March 31, 2024)

* **Long-Term Debt:** ₹28.65 crore (as of March 31, 2024). This includes Non-Current Borrowings  and the non-current portion of Lease Liabilities.


* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** ₹26.39 crore (as of March 31, 2024)


**Important Note:** These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to two decimal places as presented in the report.  Minor discrepancies might exist due to rounding differences in the original data.  The calculation for Total Liabilities is derived from the balance sheet equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)  because the reported total liabilities figure shows a slight rounding inconsistency with the other values.

### Equity Analysis
Based on the provided financial statements:

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹88.85 crore (as of March 31, 2024)

* **Retained Earnings:** ₹83.39 crore (as of March 31, 2024)

* **Share Capital:** ₹1.09 crore (as of March 31, 2024)


**Important Note:**  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to two decimal places as presented in the report.  Minor discrepancies might exist due to rounding differences in the original data.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
The provided financial statements use slightly different terminology than standard accounting practices.  Let's clarify the values based on their presentation:


* **Revenue:** ₹124.05 crore (This represents "Total Income," which combines "Revenue from Operations" and "Other Income").

* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹32.39 crore (This is represented as "Cost of Medicines & Hospital consumables consumed"). Note that this is *not* a detailed cost of revenue figure. It only includes the direct cost of goods sold in the pharmacy and consumables used in patient care. Other direct costs are included under "Consulting charges to Doctors" (₹17.57 crore).  A complete cost of revenue would need these added, along with any other direct costs not explicitly stated.

* **Gross Profit:** Cannot be precisely calculated from the provided information.  To determine gross profit, we need a complete cost of revenue figure, including all direct costs associated with generating revenue from operations, not just the cost of medicines and consumables.

* **Operating Expenses:** ₹77.90 crore (This is an approximation. The report lists many expense categories under "Expenses." To get this total, you would sum up all these: Cost of Medicines & Hospital consumables, Consulting charges to Doctors, Employee benefits expense, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Other Expenses.   )

* **Operating Income:** ₹46.15 crore. (This is calculated as the difference between "Revenue from Operations" (₹121.96 crore) and the approximated "Operating Expenses" (₹77.90 crore).  Again, because of the non-standard cost of revenue presentation, this is an approximation).


**Important Note:**  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to two decimal places as presented in the report.  Due to the way the report presents its cost of revenue, these calculations, especially Gross Profit and Operating Income, are approximations.  A truly accurate calculation requires a more detailed breakdown of the company's costs.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Based on the Statement of Profit and Loss:

* **Net Income (Profit After Tax):** ₹17.97 crore

* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** ₹36.26 crore (This is explicitly stated in the financial highlights section).

* **Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):** ₹164.25

* **Diluted EPS:**  The report states that the basic and diluted EPS are the same at ₹164.25.  This means there were no dilutive securities outstanding during the year.


**Important Note:** All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are presented as reported in the annual report.  Minor rounding discrepancies might exist in the original financial data.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on the Cash Flow Statement:


* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹34.41 crore

* **Investing Cash Flow:** ₹-13.82 crore (negative indicates a net cash outflow)

* **Financing Cash Flow:** ₹-24.35 crore (negative indicates a net cash outflow)


**Important Note:**  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are presented as reported in the annual report.  Minor rounding discrepancies might exist in the original financial data.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The annual report doesn't directly provide a single line item for "Free Cash Flow."  We need to calculate it.  Free cash flow is generally calculated as:

**Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures + Proceeds from sale of PPE**

Based on the information provided:

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹34.41 crore

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  ₹13.82 crore (This is derived from the investing cash flows section, representing purchases of PPE, but excludes any proceeds from sales).

* **Proceeds from Sale of PPE:** ₹24.30 Lakh (₹0.24 crore)  (This was from the investing activities section).

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹10.90 crore


Therefore, the estimated free cash flow is:

**Free Cash Flow ≈ ₹34.41 crore - ₹13.82 crore + ₹0.24 crore = ₹20.83 crore**


**Important Note:** This free cash flow calculation is an approximation.  A precise calculation might require further information not explicitly available in the provided report.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹).

### Profitability Ratios
Precise calculation of profitability ratios is impossible due to the incomplete cost of revenue information in the financial statements.  The report doesn't provide a clear separation of direct costs from operating expenses, which is essential for calculating gross profit and subsequent ratios.  We can, however, provide estimations and highlight the limitations:


* **Gross Margin:** Cannot be accurately calculated.  We need a complete cost of goods sold figure to determine gross profit (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold), which is a prerequisite for the gross margin calculation (Gross Profit / Revenue).

* **Operating Margin:** Approximately 37.8%. This is a rough estimate calculated as (Operating Income / Revenue) ≈ (₹46.15 crore / ₹124.05 crore) * 100%.  The inaccuracy stems from the approximate nature of the "Operating Income" calculation due to incomplete cost of revenue information.

* **Net Profit Margin:** Approximately 14.5%. This is calculated as (Net Income / Revenue) = (₹17.97 crore / ₹124.05 crore) * 100%.

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** Approximately 20.2%.  This is calculated as (Net Income / Shareholders' Equity) = (₹17.97 crore / ₹88.85 crore) * 100%.

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** Approximately 12.5%. This is calculated as (Net Income / Total Assets) = (₹17.97 crore / ₹143.82 crore) * 100%.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Inaccuracies:** The operating margin is an approximation because the cost of revenue isn't fully detailed.  Consequently, the gross margin cannot be calculated.
* **Rounding:** The numbers above are rounded to one decimal place.  Slight discrepancies might occur due to rounding within the original financial statements.
* **Comparative Analysis:** To make these ratios meaningful, it's critical to compare them to prior years' data and industry benchmarks.  The report lacks this necessary comparative context.

To obtain precise values for these ratios, a more detailed income statement is required, including a complete cost of goods sold/revenue breakdown.

### Liquidity Ratios
Using the figures from the balance sheet:

* **Current Ratio:** This ratio is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.  Therefore, the current ratio is approximately 1.22 (₹25.04 crore / ₹20.45 crore).

* **Quick Ratio:** This ratio is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.  Therefore, the quick ratio is approximately 0.98 (₹25.04 crore - ₹14.70 crore / ₹20.45 crore).

* **Cash Ratio:** This ratio is calculated as (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities.  Therefore, the cash ratio is approximately 0.29 (₹5.96 crore / ₹20.45 crore).


**Important Note:** These ratios are calculated using the figures reported in the annual report. There may be minor discrepancies due to rounding.  The interpretation of these ratios requires comparison to industry benchmarks and trends over time, which are not provided in this report.  A low cash ratio indicates potentially limited short-term liquidity.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating precise efficiency ratios requires more detailed information than is provided in the annual report.  The report doesn't directly give figures for net sales (needed for asset and receivables turnover) or purchases (needed for inventory turnover). We can offer estimations with significant limitations:


* **Asset Turnover:**  This is calculated as Net Sales / Average Total Assets.  We don't have a clear "Net Sales" figure.  Using the "Revenue from Operations" (₹121.96 crore) as a proxy (though it's not strictly accurate), and assuming average total assets are approximately the average of the beginning and ending total assets (this is a simplification),  we can obtain a rough estimate.  This approximation would be highly inaccurate and not reliable due to many factors including potential differences in non-operating activities, expenses, and the method of average asset calculation.

* **Inventory Turnover:** This is calculated as Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  We don't have the precise "Cost of Goods Sold" figure for the hospital (as explained previously, the cost of medicines and consumables alone is not sufficient).  Also using the average inventory value from the beginning and end of the year is an over simplification and is not always representative.  Therefore, we can't calculate this ratio accurately.

* **Receivables Turnover:** This is calculated as Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable.  "Net Credit Sales" is not explicitly stated; even if we use Revenue as a proxy, the level of accuracy would be too low to report a meaningful value.  Similarly, we would need to simplify the average calculation to compute this ratio, which again would not be reliable.


**In summary:**  Precise calculations of asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover are not possible with the limited data provided in the annual report.  The report needs to provide more specific line items for accurate computation.  Any estimation would be unreliable.

### Leverage Ratios
Using figures from the balance sheet and income statement:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** This ratio is calculated as Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity. Total debt is the sum of current and non-current borrowings (₹28.65 Cr + ₹2.38Cr = ₹31.03 crore).  Shareholders' equity is ₹88.85 crore. Therefore, the debt-to-equity ratio is approximately 0.35 (₹31.03 crore / ₹88.85 crore).

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** This ratio is calculated as Total Debt / Total Assets. Using the same total debt figure as above, and total assets of ₹143.82 crore, the debt-to-assets ratio is approximately 0.22 (₹31.03 crore / ₹143.82 crore).

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** This ratio is calculated as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  EBIT is not explicitly stated but can be approximated from the profit before tax figure by adding back the tax expense. EBIT ≈ Profit Before Tax + Tax Expense = ₹23.76 crore + ₹5.78 crore = ₹29.54 crore. Interest expense is ₹3.29 crore (from Finance Costs, excluding other borrowing costs). Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is approximately 8.98 (₹29.54 crore / ₹3.29 crore).


**Important Note:**  These ratios are calculated using the figures reported in the annual report. There may be minor discrepancies due to rounding.  Interpretation requires comparison to industry benchmarks and trends over time.  The EBIT calculation is an approximation, thus slightly impacting the interest coverage ratio's precision. Note also that the calculation of "Total Debt" includes all borrowings.  In other contexts, some may use only long-term debt in these calculations.  Always check the definitions used when analyzing financial reports.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided annual report doesn't contain sufficient information to calculate the market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield precisely.  Here's why and what we *can* estimate with limitations:

* **Market Cap:**  Market capitalization is calculated as the current market price per share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares.  The annual report provides the number of outstanding shares but *not* the current market price per share.  This is information that would be available from the stock exchange where the company is listed.  Without the market price, the market cap cannot be calculated.

* **PE Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):** The PE ratio is calculated as Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS).  Since we lack the market price per share, we cannot calculate the PE ratio.

* **PB Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):**  This ratio is calculated as Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share.  Again, we need the market price per share, which isn't provided.

* **Dividend Yield:** This is calculated as Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share.  We have the annual dividend per share (₹10), but we lack the market price per share, making calculation impossible.


* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** This can be calculated, based on the information given.  The dividend payout ratio is the percentage of net income paid out as dividends.


    Dividend Payout Ratio = (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100% 
    ≈ (₹10.90 crore / ₹17.97 crore) * 100% 
    ≈ 60.6%


**In summary:**  The market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield cannot be determined without the current market price per share. The dividend payout ratio can be estimated, but its accuracy depends on the precision of the reported financial figures.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹).



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The annual report identifies two main business segments:

**1. Healthcare Services:**

* **Operating Margin:** Cannot be precisely determined.  The annual report doesn't provide a segment-specific operating margin calculation for this segment alone.
* **Market Share:**  Not specified in the annual report.
* **Key Products/Services:**  MBBS medical education, allied health sciences courses, and Diplomate of National Board courses.
* **Geographic Presence:** Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.


**Limitations:**

* **Operating Margin:** The annual report does not break down operating expenses by segment, making accurate operating margin calculations for each segment impossible.
* **Market Share:** The report doesn't provide data on market share within the healthcare or medical education sectors.  Such information would need to be obtained from external market research reports.


The report provides a general overview of the company's activities.  A more detailed breakdown of segment performance would be needed for a more detailed analysis.

### ESG Ratings
The provided annual report does not include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  While the report details various ESG initiatives undertaken by KMCH, it does not reference any scores or assessments from organizations that specialize in ESG ratings (e.g., MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv).  To find ESG ratings for KMCH, you would need to consult independent ESG rating providers directly.

### ESG Initiatives
The KMCH annual report highlights many ESG initiatives, but the level of detail and quantification varies significantly across the categories.  Here's a summary:

**I. Environmental Initiatives:**

* **Renewable Energy:** KMCH has invested in a substantial solar power generation plant (5.25 MW initially, expanded by a further 5 MW) and purchases wind-generated power, covering a significant portion (around 68%) of its annual power needs.  This initiative directly reduces reliance on fossil fuels and decreases its carbon footprint.

This includes establishing a dedicated, free pediatric oncology ward and an affordable palliative care ward.  The report highlights its efforts in delivering high-volume, low-cost care through its medical college general hospital.
* **Employee Well-being:** The report mentions various initiatives to support employee well-being, including health insurance, accident insurance, and training programs.  However, it lacks specific details on these programs' scope and impact.  Employee retention is also highlighted as a key focus area.
* **Community Engagement:**  The hospital engages with the community through medical camps and other initiatives.  The scope and details of this engagement are not extensively described in the report.

**IV. Governance Practices:**

* **Board Committees:**  KMCH has established various board committees (Audit, Nomination & Remuneration, Stakeholders Relationship, CSR, and Risk Management) to oversee different aspects of the company's operations.
* **Corporate Governance Compliance:** The report states adherence to SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) corporate governance regulations.
* **Vigil Mechanism:** A whistleblower mechanism is in place to allow reporting of unethical behavior or suspected fraud.
* **Code of Conduct:**  The company has implemented codes of conduct for directors and senior management personnel.


**V. Sustainability Goals:**

The annual report doesn't explicitly define long-term sustainability goals with specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) targets.  While various environmental and social initiatives are described, there's a lack of clearly stated and quantified sustainability goals with timelines for achievement.  The report focuses more on current practices than future sustainability aspirations.


**Overall:**  KMCH's annual report provides a glimpse of its ESG efforts, especially in renewable energy and affordable healthcare.  However, the report lacks detailed, quantified data on its environmental impact and the social and governance aspects of its performance and future aspirations.  More robust and transparent reporting with measurable targets would significantly strengthen its ESG disclosures.





## Additional Information
### Operational Metrics
The annual report does not explicitly state a separate line item for R&D expenditure. While the report details significant capital expenditures on new technologies and equipment, it does not separate this spending into research and development versus other capital investments.

The total employee count (permanent and other) as of March 31, 2024, is reported as 5,286.

### Key Events
The annual report highlights many significant events during the fiscal year 2023-24:

* **Technological Advancements:**  The introduction of many advanced medical technologies represents a significant event.  This includes the AI-driven CORI Robotic Joint Replacement system, a Siemens 3D C-arm for enhanced surgical precision, and the EnSite™ X EP System for cardiac arrhythmia treatment (first in Tamil Nadu).  These investments significantly upgrade KMCH's capabilities and improve its competitive advantage.

* **New Super-Speciality Facilities:**  The inauguration of new super-speciality facilities at the Sulur branch, including a cath lab and MRI facilities, expands KMCH's reach and accessibility to patients in that region. This is a significant event expanding the geographic presence and patient capacity of the organization.

* **Growth in Medical College:**  The continued success of the KMCH Institute of Health Sciences & Research (Medical College), with a full intake of MBBS students, showcases its growth in medical education and its contribution to the healthcare workforce. This is significant for establishing KMCH as a leader in the healthcare education landscape.

* **Social Initiatives:**  The establishment of a new pediatric oncology ward in collaboration with the Rotary Club is a significant social impact initiative, expanding access to affordable cancer treatment for children.  The addition of an affordable palliative care ward also expands the types of healthcare services that are available.

* **Awards and Recognitions:**  Numerous awards received by KMCH (Best Performing Hospital, rankings in various specialties, Diamond Status Award for stroke care) underscore its clinical excellence and reinforce its strong brand reputation.  These awards are significant public recognition of quality and market leadership.


These events showcase KMCH's focus on technological advancement, expansion of services, social responsibility, and the pursuit of clinical excellence.  They represent key milestones in the company's growth and development during the year.

### Audit Information
**Auditor's Opinion:**

The independent auditor, VKS Aiyer & Co., Chartered Accountants, issued an unmodified (clean) opinion on KMCH's financial statements. This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India (including Indian Accounting Standards – Ind AS), and free from material misstatements.  The auditors did note one qualification related to the non-registration of lease agreements, which management responded to, indicating that the process of registration was underway.

**Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report outlines many key accounting policies applied by KMCH in preparing its financial statements. Key among them are:

* **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from healthcare services (inpatient and outpatient) is recognized when performance obligations are met, generally upon service delivery.  Revenue from educational courses is recognized over time using a straight-line method.  Other revenue streams (dietary sales, interest, etc.) are recognized based on specific criteria defined by accounting standards.

* **Leases:**  KMCH accounts for leases using Ind AS 116, classifying them as either finance or operating leases.  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for most leases.

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** PPE is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, with useful lives determined by management's assessment.

* **Intangible Assets:**  Intangible assets (e.g., software licenses) are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives.

* **Inventories:**  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method to determine cost.

* **Employee Benefits:**  The company uses both defined contribution and defined benefit plans for employee benefits.  Defined contribution plan contributions are expensed when services are rendered.  Defined benefit plan liabilities are determined using actuarial valuations.

* **Taxation:**  Income tax expense includes current tax and deferred tax, calculated based on the tax rates and laws in effect at the reporting date.

* **Financial Instruments:** Financial instruments are recognized at fair value upon initial recognition and measured subsequently at either amortized cost or fair value, depending on their classification and intended use.

* **Segment Reporting:**  The company presents financial information for its two operating segments – Healthcare Services and Education Services -  in accordance with its internal reporting structure.

* **Fair Value Measurement:**  The company follows a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements, using observable inputs wherever possible.

These policies are applied consistently throughout the reporting period.  The complete list of accounting policies and related disclosures are detailed in the “Notes to Financial Statements” section of the annual report.
