### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The company faces intense competition, impacting pricing power, particularly in the US formulations market.
*   **Likelihood:** High. The global generics market is highly competitive, with many players, leading to continuous price erosion.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. Competition in the generics space is intensifying, with new players entering existing product markets.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Expand the volume of the existing portfolio.
    *   Launch of new products.
    *   Move up to the complex product, such as value chain.
    *   Continued focus on brand building.
    *   Implementation of various cost optimization.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. The company's strategies, such as focusing on complex generics and brand building, have shown some success (e.g., US revenue growth), but the overall impact on profitability margins needs further assessment over time.
*   **Potential financial impact:**
    *   Continued price erosion can significantly impact profitability, potentially offset by volume increases and cost optimization.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The company's global operations, spanning over 75 countries, with 37 manufacturing facilities, expose it to supply chain disruptions.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate to High. Geopolitical tensions and socio-economic threats contribute to the likelihood of supply chain interruptions.
*   **Trend:** Stable. Geopolitical and socio-economic factors are constant, with increasing threats.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Vertical intergration.
    *   Agile production plannig.
    *   Resilient supplier ecosystem.
    *   End-to-end supply chain.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderate. Vertical integration and supplier diversification help mitigate some risks, but external factors remain largely uncontrollable.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant. Disruptions can lead to inability to service customer demand, affecting revenue and potentially increasing costs due to expedited shipping or alternative sourcing.

### Financial Risks

*   **Severity:** Moderate. The company's international operations expose it to currency volatility.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Currency fluctuations are ongoing, especially given the company's presence in diverse emerging markets.
*   **Trend:** Stable.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adoption of appropriate hedging strategy.
    *   Use of natural hedging.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderate. Hedging strategies are in place, but their effectiveness depends on the accuracy of currency movement predictions.
*   **Potential Financial Impact**: Revenue, profit, assets and liabilities can vary considerably depending on the currency fluctuations. Hardening crude oil prices is presented as a headwind.

### Compliance / Regulatory Risks
