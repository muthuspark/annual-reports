## Financial Analysis of Viji Finance Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Financial Performance Trend Analysis (FY23-FY24)

*   **Profitability Decline:** Significant downturn in profitability during FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2022-23.
    *   **Standalone:** Total Income decreased by 7.76% (INR 192.75 Lakhs vs. INR 208.96 Lakhs). Profit After Tax (PAT) fell sharply by 72.70% (INR 12.02 Lakhs vs. INR 44.03 Lakhs). Basic & Diluted EPS dropped from INR 0.05 to INR 0.01.
    *   **Consolidated (up to Jan 10, 2024):** Total Income was INR 137.56 Lakhs (vs. INR 208.96 Lakhs in prior full year). Consolidated PAT (up to Jan 10, 2024) was INR 13.80 Lakhs compared to INR 43.30 Lakhs in the prior full year, indicating a substantial decrease on an annualized basis. Consolidated Basic & Diluted EPS was INR 0.02 compared to INR 0.05 previously.
    *   **Stated Reasons:** Decline primarily due to decreased interest income coupled with increased overall expenses.
*   **Key Financial Ratios (Standalone):**
    *   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Decreased by 80.61% YoY, reflecting lower profits relative to finance costs.
    *   **Current Ratio:** Increased by 124.14% YoY, primarily due to increased current assets and decreased current liabilities.
    *   **Debt-Equity Ratio:** Increased by 43.42% YoY, indicating higher leverage due to increased debt relative to equity.
    *   **Operating Profit Margin (%):** Decreased by 27.27% YoY, impacted by higher operating expenses.
    *   **Net Profit Margin (%):** Decreased significantly by 71.43% YoY, owing to increased indirect expenses and reduced turnover.
    *   **Return on Net Worth (%):** Decreased by 2.65% compared to the previous financial year, directly linked to reduced net profit.
*   **Overall Trend:** Negative trend in core profitability and efficiency ratios, alongside increasing financial leverage. The disposal of the subsidiary impacts the comparability of consolidated figures.

### Major Strategic Initiatives and Progress (FY24 & Subsequent)

*   **Capital Restructuring:**
    *   Increased Authorized Share Capital from INR 11 Cr to INR 18 Cr (Approved EGM Nov 30, 2023).
    *   Successfully completed a Rights Issue post-FY end (July 3, 2024), raising INR 9 Crores by issuing 6 Crore equity shares. This significantly increased the paid-up capital from INR 8.25 Cr to INR 14.25 Cr, strengthening the capital base.
*   **Portfolio Adjustment:**
    *   Disposed of the entire stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Viji Housing Finance Limited, effective January 10, 2024. This simplifies the corporate structure and potentially focuses resources on the core NBFC business.
*   **Leadership & Governance:**
    *   Strengthened the board with the appointment of Ms. Palak Malviya and Mr. Rajendra Sahay Shrivastava as Independent Directors.
    *   Secured shareholder approval for the re-appointment and revised remuneration of the Chairman & Managing Director (Mr. Vijay Kothari) and the Whole-Time Director (Mr. Nitesh Gupta).
    *   Appointed new Statutory Auditors (Dharmendra K Agarwal & Co.) upon completion of the previous auditor's term.
*   **Funding:**
    *   Sought shareholder approval for material related party transactions involving unsecured loans up to INR 25 Crores from the Chairman & Managing Director (Mr. Vijay Kothari) for FY 2024-25, indicating a potential funding line.

### Risk Landscape Changes

*   **Regulatory Risk:** The NBFC sector faces heightened regulatory scrutiny. Key aspects impacting Viji Finance include:
    *   Compliance with RBI's Scale Based Regulations (classified as NBFC-Base Layer).
    *   Adherence to KYC, AML, and Fair Practice Code norms.
    *   Increased focus on unsecured lending norms by RBI (though impact level on Viji Finance is not detailed).
    *   Secretarial Audit highlighted delays in regulatory filings (RBI DNBS-02, Shareholding Pattern) and pending KYC data uploads to CICs, indicating areas for compliance improvement.
*   **Credit Risk:** Core risk for an NBFC.
    *   The Independent Auditor identified the estimation of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets as a Key Audit Matter, highlighting the significant judgment involved.
    *   Provision for Non-Performing Assets stood at INR 27.05 Lakhs as of March 31, 2024.
*   **Operational Risk:**
    *   Reliance on IT systems for financial reporting was noted as a Key Audit Matter by the auditors, emphasizing the need for robust IT controls.
*   **Market Risk:** Performance decline was attributed partly to market conditions impacting interest income and expenses. General economic volatility remains a factor.
*   **Governance Risk:** While policies are stated to be in place (Vigil Mechanism, Codes of Conduct), the Secretarial Audit qualifications point to execution gaps.

### ESG Initiatives and Metrics

*   **Environmental:** Operations are not energy-intensive. Focus is on reducing paper usage via electronic communication. No specific metrics on energy consumption, emissions, or waste management were provided.
*   **Social:**
    *   Policy against Sexual Harassment is in place with an Internal Committee constituted; zero cases were reported in FY24.
    *   Employee relations reported as positive. No data on diversity, employee training, or community engagement was provided.
    *   CSR provisions were not applicable due to the company not meeting the required thresholds.
*   **Governance:**
    *   Board composition stated as compliant (pre-Rights Issue). Post Rights Issue (July 2024), the increased capital necessitates compliance with stricter Corporate Governance norms (Regulation 15 of SEBI LODR) within six months.
    *   Committees (Audit, NRC, Stakeholders Relationship) are constituted, with composition detailed.
    *   Adoption of Code of Conduct and Insider Trading Code confirmed. Compliance with Secretarial Standards stated.
    *   Director independence declarations received and noted by the Board.

## Viji Finance Limited (FY 2023-24) - Financial Analysis Report

### Cash Flow Analysis (Standalone)

*   **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO):** The company reported a net cash outflow from operating activities of INR 428.87 Lakhs for FY24, compared to an outflow of INR 350.20 Lakhs in FY23. The primary driver for the operating cash outflow is the significant increase in loans disbursed (increase in other financial assets used in operations), partially offset by profit before tax (INR 17.02 Lakhs) and adjustments for non-cash items like depreciation (INR 35.17 Lakhs) and provisions (INR 27.72 Lakhs). The increase in operating outflow compared to FY23 suggests expansion in lending activities outpacing operational profits and collections during the year.
*   **Cash Flow from Investing Activities (CFI):** Net cash outflow from investing activities was INR 155.03 Lakhs in FY24, a substantial increase from INR 1.55 Lakhs outflow in FY23. This was primarily driven by the purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) amounting to INR 166.29 Lakhs (mainly vehicles), partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investments (INR 11.24 Lakhs, likely related to the subsidiary sale).
*   **Cash Flow from Financing Activities (CFF):** Net cash inflow from financing activities stood at INR 600.56 Lakhs in FY24, compared to an inflow of INR 390.90 Lakhs in FY23. The inflow was mainly due to proceeds from borrowings (INR 1151.88 Lakhs, primarily from related parties and vehicle loans), which exceeded the repayment of borrowings (INR 541.42 Lakhs) and finance costs paid (INR 51.75 Lakhs).
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Calculated as CFO minus Purchases of PPE, the FCF was negative INR 595.16 Lakhs (CFO of -428.87 Lakhs minus Capex of 166.29 Lakhs). This compares to a negative FCF of INR 351.75 Lakhs in FY23. The negative FCF reflects the nature of the NBFC business where loan disbursements (part of operating activities in the cash flow statement format used) are a primary use of funds, combined with capital expenditure.

### Working Capital and Liquidity (Standalone)

*   **Working Capital Structure:** As an NBFC, the core operations involve managing financial assets (primarily loans) and financial liabilities (borrowings). Loans increased significantly to INR 2,396.12 Lakhs (net) from INR 1,981.98 Lakhs (net) in FY23. This was funded mainly by an increase in borrowings, which rose to INR 1,335.81 Lakhs from INR 919.52 Lakhs. A substantial portion of borrowings (INR 1,150.86 Lakhs) is from the Promoter/Director, Mr. Vijay Kothari, provided interest-free.
*   **Liquidity Position:** The Current Ratio, based on the maturity analysis (assets/liabilities expected to be recovered/settled within 12 months), appears constrained. Assets maturing within 12 months (INR 303.48 Lakhs, primarily cash, other financial assets, and estimated loan recoveries) were significantly lower than liabilities maturing within 12 months (INR 1,318.31 Lakhs, primarily borrowings and payables). This indicates a potential reliance on refinancing or continued support from lenders, particularly related parties, to meet short-term obligations. *Note: This calculated ratio (0.23) differs significantly from the 1.93 reported in the MD&A, suggesting potential differences in classification or calculation methodology.* Cash and cash equivalents stood at INR 140.89 Lakhs at year-end, up from INR 124.23 Lakhs.
*   **Maturity Analysis:** Note 39 indicates a significant portion of borrowings (INR 1,205.38 Lakhs out of INR 1,335.81 Lakhs) are due within one year, while loan recovery timelines are not explicitly split within the note but are the primary asset class. This mismatch underscores the liquidity risk managed through refinancing and promoter support.

### Capital Expenditure (Standalone)

*   The company incurred INR 166.29 Lakhs towards the addition of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) in FY24, compared to INR 1.55 Lakhs in FY23.
*   The significant increase was primarily due to the purchase of vehicles (INR 155.06 Lakhs). Other additions included Computers (INR 6.89 Lakhs) and Office Equipment (INR 4.34 Lakhs).
*   The Capex aligns with the company's single operating segment (Financial Services) and likely supports business operations and expansion.

### Shareholder Returns (Standalone)

*   **Dividends:** The Board of Directors did not recommend any dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, aiming to conserve resources for growth. Unclaimed dividend for FY16 (INR 0.65 Lakhs) was transferred to the IEPF
