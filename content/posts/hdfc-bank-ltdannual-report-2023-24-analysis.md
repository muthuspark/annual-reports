## HDFC Bank Limited: Financial Analysis Report (FY 2023-24)

### Financial Performance & Trend Analysis (3-Year View)

HDFC Bank's financial performance in FY24 was significantly impacted by the merger with HDFC Limited, effective July 1, 2023. Consequently, direct comparisons with FY23 and FY22 need to consider this structural change.

#### Profitability
*   Profit After Tax (PAT) surged by 37.9% YoY to ₹60,812.3 crore in FY24. Prior years showed consistent growth (FY23: ₹44,108.7 Cr, FY22: ₹36,961.3 Cr).
*   Net Interest Income (NII) grew 25.0% YoY to ₹1,08,532.5 crore in FY24, crossing the ₹1 lakh crore mark. Prior years also exhibited strong NII growth (FY23: ₹86,842.2 Cr, FY22: ₹72,009.6 Cr).
*   Core Net Interest Margin (NIM) stood at 3.53% in FY24, influenced by the merged entity's liability profile.
*   Return on Average Assets (ROA) was 1.98% in FY24, compared to 2.07% in FY23 and 2.03% in FY22.
*   Return on Equity (ROE) was 16.1% in FY24, compared to 17.4% in FY23 and 16.9% in FY22.
*   Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) increased to ₹85.83 in FY24 from ₹79.25 in FY23 and ₹66.72 in FY22, though the growth rate was moderated by the increased share base post-merger.

#### Balance Sheet
*   Total Deposits grew 26.4% YoY to ₹23,79,786 crore in FY24. Significant growth was also seen in prior years (FY23: ₹18,83,395 Cr, FY22: ₹15,59,217 Cr). CASA ratio stood at 38.2% as of March 31, 2024, lower than pre-merger levels due to the nature of HDFC Ltd.'s funding profile.
*   Total Advances grew 55.2% YoY to ₹24,84,862 crore in FY24, heavily influenced by the addition of the mortgage portfolio. Pre-merger growth was also robust (FY23: ₹16,00,586 Cr, FY22: ₹13,68,821 Cr).
*   Total Balance Sheet size increased by 46.7% YoY to ₹36,17,623 crore in FY24.

#### Asset Quality & Capital Adequacy
*   Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio was 1.24% in FY24, slightly up from 1.12% in FY23 but comparable to 1.17% in FY22, remaining among the lowest in the industry despite the merger.
*   Net NPA ratio remained low at 0.33% in FY24 (FY23: 0.27%, FY22: 0.32%).
*   Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR) stood at 74.04% (excluding write-offs) in FY24, compared to 75.76% in FY23. Including general, floating, and contingent provisions, the ratio was 195.3%.
*   Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) under Basel III remained strong at 18.8% in FY24 (FY23: 19.26%, FY22: 18.90%), well above the regulatory requirement of 11.7%. Tier 1 capital was 16.79%.

#### Operational Efficiency
*   Cost-to-Income Ratio marginally decreased to 40.2% in FY24 from 40.4% in FY23, despite significant integration costs and branch expansion (925 new branches added). FY22 ratio was 36.9%.

### Business Segment Performance

#### Retail Banking
This segment saw substantial growth, particularly in advances (104.3% YoY), driven by the merger and continued leadership in personal loans, auto loans, and cards. The integration of the home loan business is a key focus, with efforts to cross-sell banking products to mortgage customers showing early success (85% of incremental home loan disbursals are to existing HDFC Bank savings account holders, up from 30-35% pre-merger). Digital origination remains high (e.g., 99% for personal loans). The payments business maintained leadership with over 2 crore credit cards issued and significant adoption of SmartHub Vyapar and PayZapp 2.0.

#### Wholesale Banking
This segment serves large corporates, MNCs, PSUs, emerging corporates, and SMEs. It recorded healthy growth, with the domestic loan book reaching ₹10,87,084 crore (32% YoY growth), constituting 44% of the Bank's domestic loans. Focus areas include leveraging corporate relationships, supply chain finance, and supporting government infrastructure initiatives. The addition of the Realty Finance business (Construction Finance and LRD) from e-HDFC is a new component. The Investment Banking division maintained a top 3 position in Debt Capital Markets and Syndicated INR loans.

#### Commercial and Rural Banking (CRB)
Established in 2021, CRB caters to MSMEs, farmers, healthcare, transport, and microfinance segments, particularly in Semi-Urban and Rural (SURU) areas. It is a key contributor to Priority Sector Lending (PSL). The Bank holds a leading MSME lending position in 14 states. Growth is driven by geographical expansion (presence in 2.25 lakh villages), product diversification (Agri-infrastructure, dairy, horticulture), and digitalisation efforts (BizXpress portal, Smart Saathi platform).

#### Treasury
Manages the Bank's liquidity, interest rate risk, investments, and statutory reserves. It also provides foreign exchange and derivative solutions to customers, contributing fee and trading income (₹4,001.1 crore from FX & derivatives in FY24). The Bank is a primary dealer for Government Securities.

### Major Strategic Initiatives & Progress

#### Merger Integration
The merger with HDFC Limited was completed effective July 1, 2023. Integration across business, technology, and people is reported as seamless and efficient. Synergies are manifesting through the combination of mortgage expertise and the Bank's distribution network. Cross-selling to legacy HDFC Ltd. customers is a key post-merger strategy showing positive early traction, particularly in savings account opening alongside home loans.

#### Digital Transformation ('Shift Right' Strategy)
The Bank continues heavy investment in technology, shifting from a product-centric to a customer-centric model. Key platforms like PayZapp 2.0 (7.5M registrations), SmartHub Vyapar (1.6M merchants), and Xpress Car Loans (32% of disbursements) show significant adoption. Initiatives include enhancing core banking ('Hollow the Core'), data lake development for AI/ML applications (fraud monitoring, credit decisioning), API factory for BaaS, and revamped Net/Mobile Banking platforms (planned for Q2FY25). Over 79% of acquisitions and 73% of servicing are digital. Customer uptime improved to 99.96%.

#### Branch Expansion & Re-imagining
Added 925 branches in FY24, with over 52% in SURU areas, taking the total to 8,738. The strategy involves transforming branches into engagement centers, leveraging a micro-market approach and AI-driven customer conversations, rather than purely transactional hubs. The 'Vishesh Banking Programme' targets rural customers.

#### Strengthening Growth Engines
Continued focus on areas identified under 'Project Future Ready': Commercial & Rural Banking, Government & Institutional Business, Wealth Management (AUM grew 45% to ₹6.47 lakh crore), Retail Assets, Corporate Banking, and Payments.

#### Customer Centricity ('Infinite Smiles')
The Net Promoter System (NPS) implementation saw an 8-percentage point improvement in the score (to 71) compared to FY23, indicating enhanced customer satisfaction.

### Risk Landscape & Management

#### Overall Framework
The Bank employs a multi-layered risk management framework overseen by the Board and its committees (RPMC, Audit Committee). The merger necessitated expanding this framework to cover integrated businesses and establishing a Group Risk Management function for subsidiaries.

#### Key Risks
*   *Credit Risk:* Managed through robust policies, portfolio diversification, and monitoring. GNPAs remained low at 1.24% despite the merger. Provisioning policies remain conservative.
*   *Market Risk:* Managed via Board-approved policies, limits (position, sensitivity, VaR, Stop Loss), and stress testing.
*   *Liquidity Risk:* Managed through ALM policy, ALCO oversight, and maintaining LCR (Avg. 117.35% in FY24) and NSFR (120.81% as of Mar 31, 24) well above regulatory minimums. Post-merger, managing the liability profile (lower CASA, higher borrowings) and bringing down the credit-to-deposit ratio are key focus areas.
*   *Operational Risk:* Managed via a three-line defence model, internal controls, and fraud monitoring.
*   *Technology & Cyber Risk:* Addressed through significant investments in IT infrastructure resilience, cybersecurity (Zero Trust Architecture, next-gen CSOC with AI/ML), data privacy measures, and BCP/DR planning. Identified as a key audit matter due to high automation and system complexity.
*   *Climate Risk:* Increasingly integrated into risk management. An 'ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework' is part of credit appraisal for wholesale borrowers. Physical and transition risks are being evaluated.
*   *Compliance & Reputation Risk:* Managed through strong internal policies, compliance functions, and stakeholder engagement.
*   *Group Risk:* A new focus area post-merger, involving oversight of subsidiary risk management.

#### Merger Impact
The merger introduced a different liability profile (higher borrowings, lower CASA) and the mortgage asset class, requiring adjustments in liquidity and credit risk management strategies. Integration of IT systems and accounting for the amalgamation were key audit matters.

### ESG Initiatives & Metrics

#### Strategy & Governance
ESG is integrated as a core value. Governance includes a Board-level CSR & ESG Committee and a management-level ESG Apex Council with working groups. An ESG Risk Management Policy guides lending decisions, including enhanced E&S due diligence for certain wholesale loans. The Bank issued its maiden Sustainable Bond (USD 300M) in FY24 under its Sustainable Finance Framework.

#### Environmental
*   Committed to becoming carbon neutral in operations by FY32.
*   Total Scope 1 & 2 emissions were 0.59 million tCO2e in FY24 (increase attributed to merger and expanded reporting boundary including fugitive emissions). Scope 3 emissions (3 categories reported) were 0.06 million tCO2e.
*   GHG Emissions Intensity (Scope 1+2) was 1.92 tCO2e / ₹ Crore Revenue.
*   Energy consumption was 3.03 million GJ, with intensity at 9.87 GJ / ₹ Crore Revenue (a 3.7% reduction YoY). Renewable energy consumption (solar + green tariff) was 11,772.84 GJ.
*   Initiatives include deploying automated energy management systems (568 branches), rooftop solar (720 kWp capacity), green power procurement, and achieving IGBC Green Interiors certification for 2,026 premises.
*   Waste management practices involve segregation and recycling through authorised vendors (109.7 tonnes e-waste, 20.5 tonnes battery waste recycled).

#### Social
*   *CSR (Parivartan):* Spent ₹945.31 crore in FY24, impacting over 10.19 crore beneficiaries cumulatively. Focus areas: Rural Development, Education, Skill Development, Healthcare, Financial Literacy. Key initiatives include HRDP, Smart Schools, ECSS scholarships, and support for Start-Ups.
*   *Employees:* Total employees reached 2,13,527. Gender diversity improved to 26.04% (exceeding the FY25 target of 25%), aiming for 27% by FY27. Attrition moderated by 7% YoY. Significant investment in L&D (6.65 million learning hours). Focus on employee well-being through HDFC Bank Cares and various engagement initiatives (Josh Unlimited, HUNAR).
*   *Financial Inclusion:* Over 52% of branches are in SURU areas. Active participation in government schemes like PMJDY, PMMY, PM-SVANidhi, Stand-Up India. The Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI) targets unbanked populations. Digital initiatives like Milk-to-Money ATMs enhance rural access.

#### Governance
Strong emphasis on Board independence (6 out of 12 directors are independent), transparency, ethical conduct (Code of Conduct, Whistleblower policy), and regulatory compliance. Policies address anti-corruption, human rights, and DEI.

## HDFC Bank Limited: Risk Analysis Report (FY 2023-24)

### I. Strategic Risk

*   **Key Risks:** Merger integration complexity (HDFC Ltd.), achieving synergistic growth, maintaining profitability amidst changing liability profile (lower CASA, higher borrowings post-merger), competitive pressures, execution of growth strategies (branch expansion, digital push, cross-selling).
*   **Severity:** High. Successful integration and synergy realization are critical for future performance and market position. Failure to manage the altered balance sheet structure could impact profitability (NIM pressure).
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Integration challenges are inherent in large mergers. NIM pressure is evident (Core NIM 3.53%). Execution risk exists but HDFC Bank has a strong track record.
*   **Trend:** Increasing (due to merger). The scale and complexity of operations have significantly increased post-merger.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Integration Committee overseeing workstreams (completed).
    *   Focus on cross-selling mortgage products and leveraging distribution network.
    *   Strategic branch expansion.
    *   Planned slower advances growth than deposit growth to manage Credit-to-Deposit ratio.
    *   Focus on granular deposit mobilization.
    *   Proposed capital raising via bonds to manage funding profile and support growth.
    *   New ESOP Scheme to retain talent post-merger.
    *   Digital transformation ('Shift Right' strategy, platforms like PayZapp, SmartHub Vyapar).
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Early signs positive (home loan sourcing traction), but long-term effectiveness depends on sustained execution. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) remains strong. Deposit growth robust.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Impact on Net Interest Margin (NIM), Cost-to-Income ratio, profitability growth, return on equity, and market share. Integration costs.

### II. Operational Risk

*   **Key Risks:** IT system integration and resilience (post-merger complexity), cybersecurity threats, business continuity disruptions (natural disasters, tech failures), internal process failures, fraud risk (internal/external), third-party vendor risks, data privacy breaches.
*   **Severity:** High. Operational failures can lead to significant financial loss, regulatory action, and severe reputational damage. IT resilience is paramount given high digital transaction volume.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Complex IT environments and increasing cyber threats globally elevate likelihood. Fraud instances reported by auditors.
*   **Trend:** Increasing (due to merger integration complexity and heightened cyber threats).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Three lines of defense framework (Business, ORMD, Internal Audit).
    *   Robust internal controls.
    *   ISO 22301:2019 certified Business Continuity Program, periodic DR drills.
    *   Comprehensive IT Risk & Cybersecurity framework (ISO 27001:2013 certified).
    *   Technology transformation agenda ('Hollow the Core', platform upgrades).
    *   Fraud Monitoring Committee and central vigilance team. Auditor reporting of frauds to Audit Committee.
    *   Whistle Blower Policy.
    *   Data Privacy Program led by DPO.
    *   Appointment/re-appointment of directors and auditors enhances governance.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** High application uptime. Zero data breaches reported. BCP effectiveness demonstrated. However, audit trail exceptions noted in auditors' report require attention. Fraud instances indicate ongoing risk.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Financial losses from fraud/errors, system downtime impact on revenue/customer service, costs of remediation, potential fines, reputational damage.

### III. Financial Risk

#### A. Credit Risk

*   **Key Risks:** Deterioration in asset quality (NPAs), impact of macroeconomic slowdown on borrowers, concentration risk (sectoral/counterparty), risk in unsecured lending, challenges in valuing security, risks from restructured assets.
*   **Severity:** High. Credit quality directly impacts profitability and capital adequacy.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. While current NPAs are low, economic headwinds and integration of HDFC Ltd.'s portfolio pose risks.
*   **Trend:** Stable to Slightly Increasing. Gross NPA ratio increased slightly. Net NPA also increased. Post-merger portfolio behavior needs monitoring.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Comprehensive credit risk architecture, policies, and procedures.
    *   Independent credit risk management function.
    *   Stringent underwriting standards, periodic monitoring, use of credit risk models.
    *   Portfolio diversification (industry, geography).
    *   Conservative provisioning policy.
    *   Prudential norms for income recognition, asset classification (IRAC norms).
