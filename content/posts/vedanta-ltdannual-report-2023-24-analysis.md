## Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity

*   All Segments: Fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly aluminium and zinc, and Brent crude oil prices, present significant risks. Sensitivity analysis indicates that a 10% movement in LME prices can substantially affect pre-tax profit. A 1% increase in the discount rate can have significant impact on the recoverable value, as mentioned in Key Audit Matters of Auditor's Report.
*   Oil & Gas: Changes in production forecasts and reserve estimates, alongside litigation related to cost recovery, can materially impact financial outcomes.
*   Power: Disputes over receivables and power purchase agreements represent risks, with potential financial implications.
*   Zinc India and Aluminium: Cost optimisation measures are crucial for maintaining profitability, especially with the volatility in commodity prices.
*   Overall Group: Currency fluctuations, especially the INR against the USD, present a significant risk, with a 10% strengthening or weakening having notable impacts on financials.

The Group's financial performance is sensitive to a variety of factors, with commodity prices, currency fluctuations, and operational efficiency being key. Strategic initiatives, such as vertical integration and cost reduction, aim to mitigate some of these risks. However, external factors, including regulatory changes and market demand, remain significant determinants of financial outcomes.
