## SAMHI Hotels Ltd. Financial Performance Analysis (FY2022-FY2024)

### Comprehensive Performance Overview

#### Financial Performance Analysis (FY2022-FY2024)

SAMHI Hotels Ltd. demonstrated a significant operational turnaround and revenue growth trajectory over the FY2022-FY2024 period. Total Income surged from ₹3,107 million in FY2022 to ₹7,614 million in FY2023, and further to ₹9,787 million in FY2024, representing a YoY growth of 145.1% and 28.5% respectively. This growth was driven by improved occupancy, higher average room rates (ARR), and the strategic acquisition of the ACIC portfolio in August 2023. On a pro-forma basis (including full-year ACIC impact), FY2024 Total Income reached ₹10,527 million compared to ₹9,644 million in FY2023.

EBITDA (pre-ESOP and one-time expenses) showed strong recovery and growth, moving from ₹218 million (6.5% margin) in FY2022 to ₹2,632 million (34.6% margin) in FY2023, and reaching ₹3,484 million (35.6% margin) in FY2024. Pro-forma EBITDA (pre-ESOP and one-time) for FY2024 stood at ₹3,681 million, up from ₹3,273 million in FY2023, indicating underlying operational strength and successful integration benefits from the ACIC portfolio, whose EBITDA margins improved from 30% pre-acquisition to 37.5% in Q4 FY2024.

Portfolio RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) consistently improved, from ₹1,805 in FY2022 to ₹3,777 in FY2023 and ₹4,132 in FY2024. Same-store RevPAR for FY2024 grew by 17% YoY. This reflects strong demand in key commercial markets.

Despite operational improvements, the company reported net losses: (₹4,364) million in FY2022, (₹3,386) million in FY2023, and (₹2,346) million in FY2024. The reduction in losses in FY2024 was aided by increased operating profit and a significant decrease in finance costs from ₹5,014 million in FY2023 to ₹3,948 million in FY2024, primarily due to debt reduction post-IPO. The successful IPO in FY2024, raising ₹12,000 million in fresh equity, was pivotal in recapitalizing the company and reducing debt.

*   **Strategy:**
    *   Identify and acquire underperforming hotel assets in high-demand urban areas and key commercial markets.
