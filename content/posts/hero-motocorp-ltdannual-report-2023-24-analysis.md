*   **Sensitivity to Market Fluctuations:** Hero MotoCorp's export performance has shown vulnerability to economic slowdowns (e.g., Bangladesh) and forex shortfalls, highlighting the sensitivity of revenue to macroeconomic stability in export markets.

*   **Salary Growth Sensitivity:** If the expected salary growth increases or decreases by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by ₹16.97 crores or decrease by ₹15.99 crores.
*   **NAV price Sensitivity**-If NAV prices had been 1% higher/lower, profit for the year would increase/decrease by ₹ 65.19 Crore.
*   **FX Rate Sensitivity:** A 5% strengthening/weakening of the INR against relevant foreign currencies would lead to fluctuations of ₹16.82 in Profit or Loss and 12.69 in total equity.
