### Significant Operational Changes

*   **Cost Rationalization Measures & Investment Strategy Realignment:** Being undertaken in response to market dynamics, particularly the return of major GECs to Free Dish.
*   **No New Channel Launches Planned:** Due to market changes with "big four GECs" entering Free Dish.

### Ongoing or Completed Projects

*   **Channel Breakeven Status:** One channel broke even ~1.5 years ago, another is near breakeven. Shemaroo Umang is the primary channel requiring substantial investment. Chumbak TV has not broken even but shows a positive outlook.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Insights about Industry Trends

*   **Consolidation in Broadcasting:** Negatively impacted Shemaroo's TV syndication business.
*   **Subdued Advertising Outlook:** Expected in the near term due to macroeconomic pressures, geopolitical tensions, and major sporting events (IPL), particularly for non-sports categories.
*   **Return of Major Broadcasters (GECs) to Free Dish Platform:** Expected to affect viewership across categories and lead to redistribution of advertising spends.
*   **Direct-to-Mobile (D2M) Technology:** Viewed as a potential new distribution mechanism for existing apps/content rather than a standalone revenue model changer for Shemaroo.

### Competitive Positioning Statements

*   Actively monitoring market impacts and realigning investment strategy.
*   Chumbak TV is one of the few channels not impacted by the entry of big four broadcasters on Free Dish.

### Market Challenges or Opportunities Mentioned

*   **Challenges:** Subdued ad environment, increased competition on Free Dish, decline in TV syndication.
*   **Opportunities:** Growth in digital media, potential for B2B licensing business to recover in FY26. Positive outlook for Chumbak TV.

### Comments about Market Share or Positioning

*   Broadcasting GEC channels have a viewership share of around 8.2% in the overall Hindi GEC genre.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management

*   **Margin Pressure:** Expected to continue due to ongoing accelerated inventory charge-offs.
*   **Decline in TV Syndication Business:** Significant impact on FY25 topline due to industry consolidation.
*   **Challenging Advertising Environment:** Near-term outlook remains subdued.
*   **Impact of Major GECs on Free Dish:** Affecting viewership and ad spends, requiring strategic realignment.

### Regulatory Issues Mentioned

*   **US Tariff on Films:** Management believes it is unlikely to have a major impact on Shemaroo, as it's likely aimed at US-produced films shot abroad or new releases, not catalog content or foreign films in general. Industry bodies are examining and preparing representations.

### Supply Chain or Operational Constraints

*   Not explicitly detailed as supply chain issues, but the TV syndication decline due to industry consolidation represents an operational constraint on a key revenue stream.

### Statements about Market Uncertainties
