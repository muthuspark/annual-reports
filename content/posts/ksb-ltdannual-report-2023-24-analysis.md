*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF) (Approx.):** Calculated as OCF minus purchases of PPE & Intangibles, FCF (Standalone) was approximately INR 596.21 million (FY23: INR 903.03 million).

### Working Capital Management

*   **Debtors Turnover:** Increased to 76 days in FY24 from 73 days in FY23, indicating a slight increase in the time taken to collect receivables.
*   **Inventory Turnover:** Increased marginally to 110 days in FY24 from 109 days in FY23, suggesting inventories were held for slightly longer.
*   **Trade Payables Turnover:** (Not explicitly provided, but inferred from Balance Sheet/Cash Flow) Trade payables increased, contributing positively to operating cash flow.
*   **Overall:** Working capital changes negatively impacted OCF in FY24 compared to FY23, primarily due to the significant increase in trade receivables.

### Capital Expenditure (Capex) Analysis

*   **Standalone Capex:** Purchases of PPE and Intangibles amounted to INR 1,335.40 million (FY23: INR 1,065.58 million).
*   **Consolidated Capex:** Purchases of PPE and Intangibles were INR 1,335.40 million (FY23: INR 1,065.58 million), indicating negligible capex in the subsidiary.
*   **Segment Capex:** The segment report (Note 33, Consolidated) shows total cost incurred to acquire segment PPE as INR 1,011.14 million for Pumps and INR 209.91 million for Valves in FY24 (FY23: INR 896.12 million for Pumps, INR 173.27 million for Valves). This suggests a higher capex allocation towards the Pumps segment, consistent with its larger revenue contribution.

### Dividends and Share Buybacks

*   **Dividend FY24:** The Board proposed a final dividend of INR 4.00 per share (face value INR 2.00), representing a 200% payout. This follows a dividend of INR 3.50 per share (adjusted for split) for FY23. The dividend payout has consistently increased over the last five years (Financial Summary).
*   **Share Split:** The company executed a 1:5 stock split (INR 10 face value to INR 2 face value) effective July 25, 2024, to improve liquidity and encourage wider investor participation.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   **Debt Position:** The company appears effectively debt-free, with no significant interest-bearing borrowings listed on the standalone or consolidated balance sheets.
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Reported at 121.05 times in FY24, up significantly from 52.74 times in FY23 (MD&A). This very high ratio reflects minimal finance costs (primarily lease interest) relative to operating profit (EBIT).

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

*   **Current Ratio:** Stood at 2.13 in FY24, slightly improved from 2.05 in FY23, indicating a healthy liquidity position with current assets more than double current liabilities.
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (Estimated):** Using the turnover days provided (Debtors: 76, Inventory: 110) and estimating payables turnover days (requires calculation based on COGS/Purchases and average payables, data not fully available for direct calculation here), the CCC appears relatively stable but reflects significant capital tied up in inventory and receivables. The increase in debtor days slightly lengthens the cycle.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield Trends (Standalone)

*   **FCF Calculation:**
    *   FY24 FCF (Approx.): INR 596.21 million (OCF: 1931.61 - Capex: 1335.40)
    *   FY23 FCF (Approx.): INR 903.03 million (OCF: 1968.61 - Capex: 1065.58)
*   **Net Worth:**
    *   FY24: INR 14,250.84 million
    *   FY23: INR 12,478.44 million
*   **FCF Yield (FCF / Average Net Worth):**
    *   FY24 Yield (Approx.): 596.21 / [(14250.84 + 12478.44)/2] ≈ 4.46%
    *   FY23 Yield (Approx.): 903.03 / [(12478.44 + 10930.95)/2] ≈ 7.71%
*   **Trend:** The FCF yield decreased in FY24 compared to FY23, primarily due to higher capex and slightly lower OCF, alongside growth in the net worth base. While positive, the yield suggests a lower proportion of net worth was converted into free cash available to investors in FY24 relative to FY23.
