## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

*   FY25 saw challenges for Plastic Pipe Systems: "principally due to much lower spending by Central and State Governments on infrastructure... unseasonal rainfall... and extreme volatile situation of PVC Resin prices."
*   PVC prices changed 14 times since July'24, impacting the industry.
*   IMD forecast for above-normal rainfall in FY26 is seen as positive for crop production and inflation.
*   Crude prices expected to be range-bound ($65-70/barrel), potentially stabilizing polymer prices.
*   Plastic Piping Systems industry saw a de-growth of about 6% in volume in FY25.
*   Demand for plastic furniture is witnessing "a stagnancy."
*   Automotive (Commercial Vehicles) showed muted demand, Passenger Vehicles better. Appliances (AC, Coolers) good growth, Washing Machines subdued.
