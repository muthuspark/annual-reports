It's important to note this is different from the EBITDA figure reported in the summary which excludes depreciation and amortization.

**Important Note:**  These numbers are extracted from Anup Engineering's statement of profit and loss.  The official annual report should be consulted for the most precise and audited figures.  There might be minor discrepancies due to rounding.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Here are the values for net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS for Anup Engineering Limited for the fiscal year ended **March 31, 2024**, in Indian Rupees (₹) and using the figures provided in the annual report:

* **Net Income (Profit After Tax):** ₹10,347.50 Lakhs (₹1,034.75 million). This is the company's profit after deducting all expenses, including taxes.

* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** ₹12,675.06 Lakhs (₹1,267.51 million). This is a measure of profitability that excludes the non-cash charges of depreciation and amortization, giving a clearer picture of the company's operating performance.

* **Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS):** ₹52.20.  This represents the net income attributable to each ordinary share outstanding.

* **Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS):** ₹51.85. This is similar to basic EPS, but it considers the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares that could be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options.


**Important Note:** These values are extracted from Anup Engineering's financial statements.  The official annual report should be consulted for the most precise and audited data.  Minor differences may occur due to rounding.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Here's a summary of Anup Engineering Limited's cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the year ended **March 31, 2024**, in Indian Rupees (₹) in Lakhs, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flows:

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹16,938.43 Lakhs (₹1,693.84 million). This represents the cash generated from the company's core business operations.  It includes adjustments to net income for non-cash items and changes in working capital.

* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(15,252.34) Lakhs (A cash outflow of ₹1,525.23 million). This reflects the cash used in investing activities, primarily capital expenditures (purchase of property, plant, and equipment) and investments in securities.

* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹(1,336.05) Lakhs (A cash outflow of ₹133.61 million). This section shows the cash flows related to financing the business, such as proceeds from share capital, long-term borrowings, dividend payments, and principal repayments on lease liabilities.


**Important Note:** These figures are taken directly from Anup Engineering's Statement of Cash Flows. Refer to the official annual report for the most precise and audited information.  Slight discrepancies might arise from rounding.

### Cash Flow Metrics
To calculate free cash flow (FCF), we need to make some assumptions based on the information provided in the annual report since a direct FCF figure isn't explicitly stated.  We will use the figures already extracted.

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** ₹4,291.18 Lakhs (₹429.12 million). This is calculated from the cash flow statement as the "Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment (including Capital advances)".

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹1,466.75 Lakhs (₹146.68 million). This is explicitly stated in the cash flow statement.

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  To estimate FCF, we'll use the common formula:  FCF = Operating Cash Flow - CAPEX.

    Using the values extracted from the statement of cash flows:
    FCF ≈ ₹16,938.43 Lakhs - ₹4,291.18 Lakhs = ₹12,647.25 Lakhs  (₹1,264.73 million).

**Important Considerations:**

* **This FCF calculation is an approximation.**  A more precise FCF calculation might include other items like changes in working capital not directly related to operations and potentially other capital expenditures.
* **The annual report doesn't provide a detailed breakdown of all CAPEX** components, which could affect the precision of our estimate.  Some items in the "Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment" might not be entirely CAPEX.
* **Always refer to the company's official disclosures** for the most accurate and complete free cash flow information.  They may use a different methodology or include additional factors.

Therefore, while ₹12,647.25 Lakhs is a reasonable estimate based on the provided data, it should not be considered the definitive FCF figure without further information from the official report.

### Profitability Ratios
To calculate the profitability ratios, we'll use the figures previously extracted from Anup Engineering Limited's financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.  Remember that these are calculations based on the reported figures and may differ slightly from the company's official reporting due to rounding or different accounting treatments.  All percentages are rounded to two decimal places.

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹10,711.22 Lakhs / ₹55,038.45 Lakhs) * 100 = 19.46%

* **Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹(58.03) Lakhs / ₹55,038.45 Lakhs) * 100 = -0.11%  This is a loss. Note that this calculation uses EBIT.  The MD&A reports a different operating margin (21.5%) presumably using a different calculation, possibly EBITDA or including some adjustments.

* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹10,347.50 Lakhs / ₹55,038.45 Lakhs) * 100 = 18.80%

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100  To calculate the average shareholders' equity, we would need the shareholders' equity for the beginning of the fiscal year (not provided).  Therefore, this ratio cannot be accurately calculated here.  However, the MD&A provides the ROE, which was 19.58% for FY 2023-24

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100. Similar to ROE, we require the total assets for the beginning of the fiscal year to compute the average, which is not available. Therefore, this ratio cannot be calculated from the provided information.


**Important Note:**  These calculations are based on information extracted from the provided report.  Always cross-reference with the company's official financial statements for the most accurate results.  Discrepancies might be due to rounding differences or to different accounting treatments between the provided extracts and the official report.  The MD&A provides certain ratios which may differ from those we calculated based on the extracts.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate the liquidity ratios for Anup Engineering Limited as of March 31, 2024, we'll use the previously extracted figures. Remember that these are calculations based on the reported numbers and might vary slightly from the company's official reporting due to rounding or slightly different accounting treatments.

* **Current Ratio:** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹46,477.48 Lakhs / ₹25,050.52 Lakhs = 1.86

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹46,477.48 Lakhs - ₹16,528.45 Lakhs) / ₹25,050.52 Lakhs = 1.19

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = ₹1,774.75 Lakhs / ₹25,050.52 Lakhs = 0.07


**Important Note:** These calculations rely on the data extracted from the provided annual report.  Always consult the official financial statements for the most accurate figures, as slight variations might occur due to rounding or different accounting treatments.



### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating Anup Engineering Limited's efficiency ratios requires using the figures previously extracted from the annual report and making some assumptions since not all necessary data points are explicitly given.  The results will be approximations, and the official annual report should be consulted for the most accurate figures.


* **Asset Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Total Assets).  We need the total assets at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate the average, which is not provided. Therefore, this ratio cannot be precisely calculated here.

* **Inventory Turnover:** (Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory). Similar to asset turnover, we need the beginning inventory value to calculate the average.  This data point is unavailable, therefore a precise calculation is not possible. The MD&A provides an inventory turnover ratio of 3.77 for FY 2023-24.

* **Receivables Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable). Again, we need the beginning accounts receivable balance to determine the average. Without this, an exact calculation is not possible. The MD&A reports a receivables turnover ratio of 3.99 for FY 2023-24.


**In summary:** While we can't calculate the precise asset turnover ratio with the available data,  the MD&A provides the inventory and receivables turnover, which were 3.77 and 3.99 times, respectively, for FY 2023-24.  Remember that these are the company's reported figures which may have slight differences due to rounding or other reporting standards.

### Leverage Ratios
Let's calculate Anup Engineering Limited's leverage ratios as of March 31, 2024, using the figures previously extracted.  Remember that these are approximations; the official annual report should be consulted for the most precise figures.

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** (Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity).  Total debt includes both current and non-current liabilities of a debt nature, which sums to ₹3,306.30 Lakhs (₹1,927.36 Lakhs + ₹1,379.00 Lakhs).

    Debt-to-Equity Ratio = ₹3,306.30 Lakhs / ₹52,844.64 Lakhs = 0.06

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** (Total Debt / Total Assets) = ₹3,306.30 Lakhs / ₹80,843.08 Lakhs = 0.04

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense) =  To calculate EBIT, we need to add back interest expense to the operating income (EBIT).  Operating income (EBIT) was a loss of ₹(58.03) Lakhs. The interest expense was ₹217.44 Lakhs.

   Interest Coverage Ratio = ₹(58.03 + 217.44) Lakhs / ₹217.44 Lakhs = 0.73. This represents that the EBIT was not sufficient to cover the interest expense.


**Important Note:** These calculations are based on the data extracted and might differ slightly from the company's official reporting due to rounding or different accounting treatments. The official annual report should always be consulted for the most accurate results.  The MD&A presents some key ratios which may differ from our calculations based on the data extracts.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
Calculating these market-based ratios requires information not directly provided in the annual report.  We need the current market price per share and the number of outstanding shares at the end of the fiscal year. The annual report provides information on the number of outstanding shares but not the market price.  Therefore, precise calculations cannot be performed.

* **Market Cap:** (Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares).  This cannot be calculated without the current market price.

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):** (Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share).  This needs both the market price and the EPS, neither of which is current in the document.

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):** (Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share).  This calculation requires the current market price per share and the book value per share (shareholders' equity/number of outstanding shares).

* **Dividend Yield:** (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100.  This needs the current market price and the annual dividend per share (which is a proposed dividend subject to shareholder approval).

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100. We know the dividends paid (₹1,466.75 Lakhs). We also have net income (₹10,347.50 Lakhs). Therefore, we can approximate this: (₹1,466.75 Lakhs / ₹10,347.50 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 14.17%.  However, this is based on the *paid* dividend, not the *proposed* dividend.


**In summary:**  Only the dividend payout ratio could be approximated using the information provided in the annual report.  To calculate the market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and the dividend yield, you would need to obtain the current market price of Anup's shares from a financial website or data provider.  The values presented here should not be considered definitive.

The company has installed a Windmill (750 KW) and a solar plant (990 KW) to utilize renewable energy sources.  Specific energy reduction targets are not stated.

* **Water Management:**  The company reports water withdrawal and consumption but lacks specific targets or goals for water efficiency. It highlights the use of a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant to minimize water discharge.

* **Waste Management:** Anup focuses on metal scrap recycling.  While specific recycling rates aren't provided, the BRSR emphasizes reducing waste generation and using environmentally friendly disposal methods.

* **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:** The BRSR reports Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (1459 and 4912 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent respectively) and intensity but doesn't include Scope 3 emissions or set reduction targets.


**II. Carbon Footprint:**

Anup's  carbon footprint is partially disclosed through its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions data.  However, the report lacks Scope 3 emissions data, making a complete assessment of its carbon footprint impossible. No specific reduction targets or goals are mentioned.


**III. Social Initiatives:**

Anup's social initiatives primarily fall under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program. Key projects include:

* **Rural Development:**  Promoting efficient irrigation systems and a bio-char project to improve agricultural practices in Botad and Sabarkatha districts.
* **Education:**  Providing digital learning programs to government school students, aiming to improve their basic digital literacy skills.

While the report describes these initiatives, it doesn't provide specific social impact metrics or targets beyond the number of people impacted.


**IV. Governance Practices:**

The  annual report  details  Anup's  governance structure, including the composition of the Board of Directors, its committees (Audit, Nomination & Remuneration, Stakeholders' Relationship, CSR, Risk Management), and their activities.  The report emphasizes compliance with the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI regulations.  It includes a whistleblower policy and affirms compliance with the code of conduct for directors and senior management.


**V. Sustainability Goals:**

Anup's  annual report doesn't explicitly state long-term, quantified sustainability goals.  While it highlights several environmental and social initiatives, it lacks specific targets for emissions reduction, resource efficiency, or social impact measurements.  This is a significant weakness in the report, hindering a robust assessment of Anup's commitment to long-term sustainability.


**Overall Assessment:**  Anup's annual report demonstrates some commitment to ESG principles. However, the lack of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals and the limited quantitative data significantly hampers a complete assessment of its sustainability performance and progress.  More robust and comprehensive reporting with specific targets and measurable indicators is necessary for improved transparency and accountability.



## Additional Information
### Operational Metrics
The annual report does not explicitly state the R&D expenditure as a separate line item. While the report mentions R&D efforts, the expenditure is not broken out from other operational costs.

Regarding employee count:

* **Permanent Employees:** 243 (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Other than Permanent Employees (Contractual Workers):** 500 (as of March 31, 2024)

Therefore, the total workforce is approximately 743.  However, it's crucial to note the distinction between permanent and other employees as it impacts benefits and cost structures.  The report does not specify how many of the 500 workers are full-time equivalents.

### Key Events
Several significant events shaped Anup Engineering Limited's fiscal year 2023-24:

* **Merger with Subsidiary:** Anup Heavy Engineering Limited (AHEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary, was merged with Anup, effective April 1, 2022. This merger is reflected in the restated financial figures for FY2022-23.

* **Acquisition of Mabel Engineers Private Limited:** This strategic acquisition expanded Anup's product portfolio (silos, storage tanks, vessels) and manufacturing footprint to Tamil Nadu, India.

* **Commissioning of New Facility:** Phase 1 of Anup's new manufacturing facility at Kheda, Gujarat, became operational, increasing its production capacity.

* **Establishment of New Design Office:** A new design office in Vadodara, Gujarat, was opened to enhance customer relationships and support.

* **Bonus Share Issue:** The Board approved a 1:1 bonus issue of equity shares, further expanding the number of outstanding shares.

* **High On-Time Delivery Performance:**  Anup maintained a strong on-time delivery record of 95%, reinforcing its reputation for reliability.

* **Strong Order Book:** Anup secured new orders worth approximately ₹853 Cr during the year, ending with a robust order book of ₹854 Cr.  A significant portion of this (57%) is from exports.


These events highlight Anup's strategic focus on growth through capacity expansion, product diversification, geographical expansion, and operational excellence.  The success of these initiatives largely contributed to Anup's strong financial performance for the year.

### Audit Information
**Auditor's Opinion:**

The independent auditor, Sorab S. Engineer & Co., Chartered Accountants, issued an **unmodified (clean) opinion** on Anup Engineering Limited's financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The audit report also includes a separate, unqualified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the company's internal financial controls over financial reporting.


**Key Accounting Policies:**  Several key accounting policies are detailed in Note 3 of Anup's annual report.  The most significant ones include:

* **Current versus Non-Current Classification:** Assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on their expected realization or settlement within the operating cycle (assumed to be 12 months).

* **Business Combinations under Common Control:**  The pooling-of-interests method was used to account for the merger of Anup Heavy Engineering Limited, reflecting the common control before and after the combination.

* **Foreign Currencies:** Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the spot exchange rate, with monetary items translated at the reporting date's exchange rate.  Differences are recognized in profit or loss.

* **Fair Value Measurement:**  Fair value is determined using market participant assumptions and categorized within a three-level hierarchy (Level 1: quoted market prices; Level 2: observable inputs; Level 3: unobservable inputs).

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment:** Assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, with useful lives reviewed annually.

* **Leases:**  Anup follows Ind AS 116, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most lease arrangements.

* **Intangible Assets:**  Intangible assets are recognized at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.  Amortization is applied over their useful lives.

* **Revenue Recognition:**  Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in accordance with Ind AS 115.

* **Financial Instruments:** Anup classifies its financial assets and liabilities based on Ind AS 109, categorizing them into different measurement categories (amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, fair value through profit or loss).

* **Employee Benefits:** Short-term benefits are recognized when services are rendered.  Post-employment benefits (defined contribution and defined benefit plans) are accounted for according to Ind AS 19.

* **Share-Based Payments:**  The cost of equity-settled transactions is measured at fair value at the grant date, with expense recognized over the vesting period.

* **Taxes:**  Income tax expense includes current and deferred taxes, calculated using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates.

* **Provisions and Contingencies:** Provisions are recognized when a present obligation is probable and can be reliably estimated.  Contingent liabilities are disclosed but not recognized.


These  key accounting policies provide the framework for preparing Anup Engineering Limited's financial statements.  Understanding these policies is crucial for interpreting the financial data presented in the annual report.  Note that this is a summary and all details are given in the annual report.
