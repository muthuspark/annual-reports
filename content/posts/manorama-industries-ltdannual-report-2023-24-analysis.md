## Cash Management

### Cash Flow and Liquidity Analysis

#### Cash Flow Analysis (FY 2023-24 vs FY 2022-23, INR Lacs)

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Reported at INR -15,025.34 Lacs in FY24, a significant decline from INR 5,981.19 Lacs in FY23. The negative OCF in FY24 was primarily driven by a substantial increase in inventories (INR -23,058.74 Lacs adjustment), outweighing the Profit Before Tax (INR 5,317.16 Lacs) and positive adjustments like Depreciation (INR 1,481.95 Lacs) and Finance Costs (INR 1,112.96 Lacs).
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Outflow decreased to INR -6,230.14 Lacs in FY24 from INR -11,307.04 Lacs in FY23. The primary driver remained the Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment (including CWIP), amounting to INR -3,964.07 Lacs in FY24 (vs. INR -5,782.61 Lacs in FY23). Investments in bank deposits (>3 months maturity) also contributed to the outflow (INR -2,269.46 Lacs in FY24).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Inflow increased significantly to INR 21,697.60 Lacs in FY24 from INR 4,902.58 Lacs in FY23. This was largely due to higher proceeds from Short-Term Borrowings (Net INR 20,495.16 Lacs) and Long-Term Borrowings (INR 3,553.80 Lacs), used to cover the operating cash deficit and investing activities. Finance costs paid (INR -1,112.96 Lacs) and dividends paid (INR -238.40 Lacs) were major outflows.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF) (OCF - Capex):** FCF turned significantly negative in FY24 at INR -18,989.41 Lacs (calculated as -15,025.34 - 3,964.07), compared to a positive INR 198.58 Lacs in FY23 (calculated as 5,981.19 - 5,782.61). This indicates cash generated from operations was insufficient to cover capital expenditures in FY24, primarily due to the large working capital absorption.

#### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Decreased substantially from 3.09 in FY23 to 1.68 in FY24, indicating slower inventory movement and a longer holding period. Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) increased from approx. 118 days to approx. 217 days. The report attributes this to increased inventory levels for upcoming capex.
*   **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:** Slightly decreased from 13.92 in FY23 to 13.06 in FY24, suggesting a minor slowdown in collections. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased marginally from approx. 26 days to approx. 28 days. The report's explanation notes efficient collection processes.
*   **Trade Payables Turnover Ratio:** Decreased drastically
