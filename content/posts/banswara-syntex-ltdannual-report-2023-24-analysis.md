The significant decline in profitability ratios (Interest Coverage, RoE, Net Profit Margin, Operating Profit Margin) is a major concern, primarily driven by a 16% decline in revenue from operations and margin pressures due to subdued export demand and domestic market challenges.

*Note: FY2022-23 segment-wise revenue figures are not explicitly provided in the "SEGMENT-WISE PERFORMANCE" section of the MD&A.

Export turnover decreased from ₹725 crore (48% of total turnover) in FY2022-23 to ₹532 crore (42% of total turnover) in FY2023-24.

### Major Strategic Initiatives and Progress

*   **Subsidiary Investment:** Invested ₹3.74 Crores in the equity shares of wholly-owned subsidiary Banswara Brands Private Limited.
*   **Future Growth Drivers (Outlook):**

### Risk Landscape Changes

*   **Major Threats Identified:**
    *   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Trade wars and restrictive trade policies disrupting supply chains and market access. (Persisting threat)
    *   **Currency Fluctuations:** Sharp variations in exchange rates creating an unpredictable business environment. (Persisting threat)
    *   **Persistent Inflation:** Rising commodity prices exerting pressure on profit margins and potentially reducing consumer purchasing power. (Persisting threat)
    *   **Raw Material Price Volatility:** Impacting production costs and overall profitability. (Persisting threat)
    *   **Subdued Demand & Pricing Pressure:** Experienced in FY2023-24, impacting exports (due to geopolitical tensions, recession/slowdown in Europe, Turkey, US, UK) and domestic market. This was a key factor in the decline in operational revenue and margins.
*   **Opportunities:**
    *   Strong domestic market foundation with rising disposable incomes and urbanization.
    *   Abundant raw materials (cotton, jute) and complete textile value chain in India.
    *   Competitive production costs due to a large, skilled workforce.
    *   Government initiatives (e.g., promoting technical textiles, SAMARTH scheme, FTAs).
    *   Potential for increased exports due to global demand diversification (China+1 strategy) and FTAs (EFTA, potential UK, Canada, EU deals).
    *   Indian yarn market expected to grow at 3-4% CAGR (fiscals 2024-2028).

The primary change in the risk landscape for FY2023-24 was the materialization of demand-side risks (subdued export and domestic demand) and pricing pressures, significantly impacting financial performance.

## Banswara Syntex Limited - FY 2023-24 Financial Analysis

### Financial Performance Overview (Standalone & Consolidated)

Banswara Syntex Limited reported a significant downturn in financial performance for FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2022-23, driven by subdued demand, geopolitical tensions, and pricing pressures in both export and domestic markets.

*   **Revenue from Operations:**
    *   Standalone: ₹1,26,401.03 Lakhs, a decrease of 15.70% from ₹1,49,944.06 Lakhs in FY23.

    *   **PBT (Standalone):** Decreased by 65.93% to ₹4,883.02 Lakhs from ₹14,332.13 Lakhs.
    *   **PAT (Standalone):** Fell by 67.70% to ₹3,646.06 Lakhs from ₹11,288.27 Lakhs.

### Operational Performance

*   **Production Volumes:**
    *   Yarn: 287 Lakh kgs (down 6.21% from 306 Lakh kgs), due to pricing pressure and subdued demand.
