| Period              | Current Assets | Current Liabilities | Working Capital |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| March 31, 2024      | 1,402.86       | 241.10              | 1161.76         |

*   **Analysis:** Gensol's working capital has significantly increased.

### Asset Quality Metrics

*   **Allowance for Expected Credit Losses (ECL):** There is a very small ECL allowance relative to the trade receivables (H 0.68 Crore vs. H 227.80 Crore in receivables).

### Debt Structure and Maturity Profile

*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
    *   March 31, 2024: (1098.34+80.18) / 320.76= 3.67
    *   March 31, 2023: (359.18+4.31) / 208.43 = 1.74

*   **Maturity Profile:** The significant increase in borrowings is notable. Many of the loans are secured against vehicles.

### Off-Balance Sheet Items

*   **Contingent Liabilities:** Bank Guarantees of H 116.14 Crore are significant.

### Overall Assessment and Recommendations

*   **Rapid Growth and Expansion:** Gensol is in a high-growth phase, evident from the substantial increases in assets, equity, and borrowings.

*   **High Leverage:** The increase in the debt-to-equity ratio indicates the company is significantly leveraging debt to finance its growth.

*   **Concentration Risk**: Although the business is diversified into Solar EPC, EV leasing, and EV manufacturing, the success of these relatively new ventures is critical.

* **Transparency and Disclosure:** Enhancing disclosures on off-balance sheet items and providing a more granular breakdown of "Other" categories in financial assets and liabilities would improve transparency.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Detailed Analysis of Borrowings:**  Obtain a detailed schedule of all borrowings, including interest rates, repayment terms, collateral, and any covenants.  Pay close attention to the terms of the new large loans.
2.  **Cash Flow Projections:** Request detailed cash flow projections, including sensitivity analysis, to assess the company's ability to service its increased debt and fund its expansion plans.
3.  **Receivables Management:** Scrutinize the trade receivables aging and the adequacy of the ECL provision.
4.  **Contingency Planning:** Understand management's plans for mitigating risks associated with the guarantees and potential claims.
5.  **Capital Expenditure Plans:** Obtain a detailed breakdown of capital expenditure plans, particularly for the EV manufacturing facility and any further solar projects.
6.  **Segmental Reporting:** For deeper analysis, review the segmental reporting provided in the Annual Report for a more detailed breakdown of performance across Solar EPC, EV Leasing, and EV Manufacturing.

## Audit & Compliance Analysis

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   **Opinion:** K. C. Parikh & Associates issued an *unmodified* (clean) opinion on both standalone and consolidated financial statements, indicating a true and fair view of Gensol Engineering Limited's financial position and performance in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).
*   **Qualifications:**
    *   **Standalone:** Procedural observation regarding the audit trail for Property, plant, and equipment not enabled.
    *   **Consolidated:** Reliance on reports of other auditors for eight subsidiaries and one step-down subsidiary. Procedural observation on the audit trail of a few subsidiaries.
    *   **Consolidated:** One subsidiary, Scorpius Trackers Private Limited, received an adverse remark from its auditors regarding the use of short-term funds for long-term assets.
*   **Key Audit Matters:** Revenue Recognition was highlighted as a Key Audit Matter (KAM) for the holding company.
*   **Analysis:** The unmodified opinion is positive. Reliance on other auditors and the procedural observation increase inherent risk. The adverse remark for the subsidiary is a cause for concern.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. For solar projects, this often involves percentage-of-completion accounting.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Gensol acts as a lessee and a lessor. The company uses the modified retrospective approach for adoption. Discount rates used are material.
*   **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** Measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method (SLM), which was a change from previous GAAP.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Includes software and intellectual property. Amortized using the straight-line method.
*   **Impairment:** Gensol uses the Expected Credit Loss model.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Measured at amortized cost or fair value.
*   **Consolidation:** Full line-by-line consolidation of subsidiaries.
*   **Changes in Accounting Policies:**
    *   Depreciation method for PPE changed from the Written Down Value (WDV) method to the Straight-Line Method (SLM) effective April 1, 2022. The impact was adjusted in the opening balance sheet as of April 1, 2022.
    *   The presentation now reports *material* accounting policies, as opposed to *significant* accounting policies.
*   **Analysis:** The change in depreciation method could significantly affect reported profits and requires assessing the reason behind this change.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   **Auditor's Report (Annexure A & B):** An *unmodified* opinion was issued on internal financial controls over financial reporting, indicating adequate and effective internal controls.
*   **Analysis:** The clean opinion on internal controls is positive.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **General Compliance:** The financial statements comply with the Companies Act, 2013, and Ind AS.
*   **SEBI Regulations:** Compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
*   **Specific Issues:**
    *   No amounts required to be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund.
    *   No instances of reporting of frauds by Auditors.
*   **Analysis:** The report indicates good general compliance.

### Legal Proceedings and Their Potential Impact

*   **Statement:** "The Company *does not have* any pending litigations which would impact its financial position".
*   **Analysis:** The absence of material pending litigation is a positive indicator.

### Related Party Transactions

*   **Disclosure:** Extensive disclosures on related party transactions (RPTs) in Form AOC-2 (Annexure C) and Note 46.
*   **Nature of Transactions:** Includes sales, purchases, rent, interest, loans, and advances.
*   **Arm's Length:** All RPTs were in the ordinary course of business and, except where noted, at arm's length.
*   **Materiality:** Shareholder approval was sought for material RPTs as per Regulation 23 of SEBI Listing Regulations.
*   **Analysis:** Gensol presents a complex organizational structure, which could pose challenges to its internal controls. The report highlights that Gensol has engaged in transactions with related parties totaling substantial amounts.

### Subsequent Events

*   **Statement:** "There are no subsequent events to be recognized or reported that are not already disclosed."
*   **Analysis:** The absence of reported subsequent events means no material changes have occurred after the balance sheet date.

### Overall Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:**
    *   **Positive:** Unmodified audit opinion, detailed disclosures, adoption of Ind AS, and established internal controls.
    *   **Areas for Further Scrutiny:** Reliance on other auditors for subsidiaries, the change in depreciation method, and the complexity of related party transactions warrant further investigation.
*   **Regulatory Risk:**
    *   **Low-Moderate:** Generally good compliance with the Companies Act and SEBI regulations. The absence of material litigation is positive.
    *   **Potential Areas of Concern:** Close monitoring of the procedural observation identified and related party transactions to ensure ongoing compliance and arm's-length pricing is crucial.
*   **Conclusion:** There are material transactions with related parties, which warrant further analysis, and procedural audit observations.
