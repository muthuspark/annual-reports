### Significant Changes in Major Line Items (Consolidated, >10% YoY for FY24 vs FY23)

### Working Capital Trends (Consolidated)

Net working capital increased significantly in FY24, driven by a substantial rise in current assets, particularly cash and cash equivalents and loans (from the financing subsidiary), outpacing the growth in current liabilities. The Current Ratio improved, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. Inventory turnover saw a slight moderation, while debtor turnover remained relatively stable. The increase in operating profit margin suggests improved operational efficiency, contributing to better working capital management despite overall growth.

## Ashok Leyland Limited Financial Analysis (FY 2023-24)

### Cash Flow Analysis (Standalone & Consolidated)

#### Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

*   **Standalone (FY24):** Net cash from operating activities stood at â‚¹2,708.64 Crores, a decrease from â‚¹2,738.08 Crores in FY23. The reduction was primarily driven by an increase in net working capital by â‚¹1,523 Crores (FY23: â‚¹105.99 Crores decrease), despite a higher profit from operations after tax (â‚¹4,026.29 Crores vs â‚¹2,562.51 Crores). Key working capital adjustments included an interim dividend remittance of â‚¹1,453.48 Crores, increased inventories (â‚¹415.86 Crores), and reduced trade payables (â‚¹868.24 Crores), partially offset by reduced trade receivables (â‚¹494.80 Crores).
*   **Consolidated (FY24):** Net cash used in operating activities was â‚¹6,099.76 Crores, a significant increase from â‚¹4,068.92 Crores used in FY23. This was despite a higher profit for the year (â‚¹2,917.13 Crores vs â‚¹1,431.05 Crores). The primary driver was a substantial increase in net working capital requirements, particularly a â‚¹9,151.87 Crore increase in non-current and current financial assets (primarily loans related to the financing subsidiary) and a â‚¹1,453.48 Crore interim dividend remittance.

#### Investing Cash Flow (ICF)

*   **Standalone (FY24):** Net cash inflow from investing activities was â‚¹901.79 Crores, a significant turnaround from a net outflow of â‚¹1,129.58 Crores in FY23. This was mainly due to proceeds from the sale of current investments (net) of â‚¹2,602.45 Crores (FY23: purchase of â‚¹1,586.64 Crores) and inter-corporate deposits repaid by subsidiary (net) of â‚¹104.90 Crores. Purchase of PPE and intangibles was â‚¹481.22 Crores (FY23: â‚¹487.94 Crores), and purchase of non-current investments (primarily in subsidiaries Optare Plc and OHM) amounted to â‚¹1,566.93 Crores.
*   **Consolidated (FY24):** Net cash inflow from investing activities was â‚¹1,083.76 Crores, compared to an outflow of â‚¹2,560.93 Crores in FY23. Key movements included proceeds from sale/ (purchase) of current investments (net) of â‚¹2,073.72 Crores (FY23: purchase of â‚¹1,893.45 Crores) and proceeds from sale of current investments relating to financing activities of â‚¹1,640.00 Crores (FY23: â‚¹1,050.00 Crores). Purchase of PPE and intangibles was â‚¹1,050.79 Crores (FY23: â‚¹842.90 Crores).

#### Financing Cash Flow (FCF)

*   **Standalone (FY24):** Net cash used in financing activities was â‚¹1,917.22 Crores, compared to â‚¹1,238.26 Crores used in FY23. Major outflows included repayments of non-current borrowings (â‚¹1,105.18 Crores), dividend paid (FY23 related) of â‚¹763.40 Crores, and interest paid (â‚¹265.62 Crores). This was partially offset by net proceeds from current borrowings of â‚¹215.30 Crores.
*   **Consolidated (FY24):** Net cash inflow from financing activities was â‚¹8,129.12 Crores, up from â‚¹7,051.72 Crores in FY23. This was driven by higher proceeds from non-current borrowings (â‚¹19,011.31 Crores vs â‚¹15,149.89 Crores) and current borrowings (â‚¹12,517.93 Crores vs â‚¹5,819.53 Crores), offset by higher repayments of non-current borrowings (â‚¹12,906.94 Crores vs â‚¹8,035.74 Crores) and current borrowings (â‚¹10,497.59 Crores vs â‚¹4,975.15 Crores). Dividend paid (FY23 related) was â‚¹763.40 Crores.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Debtors Turnover:** Standalone debtors turnover ratio remained relatively stable at 10.04 times in FY24 compared to 10.05 times in FY23. This indicates consistent efficiency in collecting receivables. Trade receivables (net) decreased from â‚¹4,049.51 Crores in FY23 to â‚¹3,554.71 Crores in FY24 (Standalone).
*   **Inventory Turnover:** Standalone inventory turnover ratio decreased to 8.76 times in FY24 from 10.70 times in FY23, suggesting a slowdown in inventory movement. Total inventories (Standalone) increased to â‚¹3,038.90 Crores in FY24 from â‚¹2,623.04 Crores in FY23, primarily due to higher finished goods inventory (â‚¹1,564.62 Crores vs â‚¹1,140.28 Crores). Consolidated inventories also rose to â‚¹4,103.98 Crores from â‚¹3,290.34 Crores.
*   **Trade Payables Turnover:** Standalone trade payables turnover ratio improved slightly to 4.86 times in FY24 from 4.67 times in FY23. However, total trade payables (Standalone) decreased to â‚¹6,207.51 Crores in FY24 from â‚¹7,075.75 Crores in FY23.
*   **Current Ratio:** Standalone current ratio slightly decreased to 0.94 in FY24 from 1.02 in FY23. Consolidated current ratio was 0.98 in FY24, down from 1.09 in FY23.
*   **Working Capital:** Standalone operating profit before working capital changes was â‚¹4,026.29 Crores. However, adjustments for changes in working capital led to a net outflow of â‚¹1,317.65 Crores (excluding dividend remittance effect), indicating increased investment in working capital during FY24. Consolidated figures show even larger working capital absorption, primarily due to the expansion of the financing business. The MD&A notes a marginal increase in working capital requirement at year-end to meet demand improvement.

### Capex Analysis

*   The Chairman's message highlights that over 30% of last year's sales came from newly launched products, indicating returns on R&D and capex in product development.

    *   FY22: â‚¹1.00 per share (Final)

*   **Finance Costs (Standalone):** Decreased by 14% in FY24 to â‚¹346.57 Crores from â‚¹401.96 Crores in FY23. This was primarily due to better management of cash and working capital, and no fresh long-term loans availed during the year. Cash generated was used to repay existing loans.
*   **Debt Position (Standalone):** Long-term borrowings stood at â‚¹1,771.31 Crores as at March 31, 2024, down from â‚¹2,913.47 Crores as at March 31, 2023. NCDs amounting to â‚¹600 Crores were redeemed, and â‚¹216.25 Crores of Rupee Term Loans and â‚¹288.73 Crores of ECBs were repaid.
