*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Net cash inflow from operating activities stood at INR 2,686.43 million in FY24, a significant increase from INR 1,663.91 million in FY23. This growth was driven primarily by higher Profit Before Tax (INR 3,577.68 million vs INR 2,554.80 million) and favorable working capital adjustments, particularly increases in trade payables and other liabilities, offsetting increases in inventories and receivables.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash outflow from investing activities was INR 1,972.57 million in FY24, compared to an inflow of INR 1,008.58 million in FY23. Key components include:
    *   Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment (Capex): INR 367.76 million (FY23: INR 477.40 million).
    *   Net increase in current investments: INR (1,118.52) million (FY23: INR 1,454.90 million inflow).
    *   Investment in Bank Deposits (net): INR (1,361.13) million outflow (FY23: INR 10.70 million outflow).
    *   Interest Received: INR 463.64 million (FY23: INR 312.28 million).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Net cash outflow from financing activities was INR 782.25 million in FY24, significantly lower than the INR 2,650.31 million outflow in FY23. The primary driver in FY23 was the share buyback (INR 1,900 million). FY24 outflow mainly comprises dividend payments (INR 731.44 million) and lease liability payments.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Calculated as OCF minus Capex (Purchase of PPE), FCF for FY24 is INR 2,318.67 million (INR 2,686.43 million - INR 367.76 million). This represents approximately 86% of the Consolidated PAT (INR 2,694.58 million), indicating strong cash generation capability after reinvestment in fixed assets. (FY23 FCF was INR 1,186.51 million).

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   The company highlights enhanced working capital management, reporting a negative working capital position of INR 1,951 million as of March 31, 2024.
*   Inventory Turnover Ratio (Consolidated): Increased to 3.84x in FY24 from 3.58x in FY23, suggesting improved inventory management efficiency.
*   Debtors Turnover Ratio (Consolidated): Marginally decreased to 10.76x in FY24 from 10.80x in FY23, reflecting slightly slower collections relative to the significant revenue growth.
*   Overall negative working capital indicates effective management, potentially funded by customer advances (INR 3,759.91 million as per Consolidated Balance Sheet) and efficient payable management.

### Capital Expenditure (Capex) Analysis

*   Capex appears directed towards capacity expansion (Sompura), geographic expansion (South Africa, USA), and digitalization (ERP).

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividend FY24:**
    *   Interim Dividend: INR 1.30 per share (130%).
    *   Special Dividend: INR 1.00 per share (100%).
    *   Proposed Final Dividend: INR 1.30 per share (130%).
    *   Total FY24 Dividend: INR 3.60 per share (360%).
    *   Total Outlay: INR 1,144.35 million.
    *   Dividend Payout Ratio (Consolidated PAT): Approx. 42.5% (INR 1,144.35 mn / INR 2,694.58 mn).
*   **Dividend FY23 (Paid in FY24/FY23):** A final dividend for FY22 (INR 0.85) and a special dividend for FY22 (INR 0.70) were paid during FY23, totaling INR 499.77 million.
*   **Share Buyback:**
    *   No buyback in FY24.
    *   FY23: Buyback of 5,428,571 shares at INR 350/share for an aggregate of INR 1,900 million.
    *   FY19: Buyback of 6,666,666 shares at INR 150/share for an aggregate of INR 1,000 million.
*   The company maintains a consistent dividend policy alongside opportunistic share buybacks, returning significant capital to shareholders, enabled by strong cash generation.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   The company is stated to be virtually debt-free, with principal financial liabilities comprising trade payables and lease liabilities. The Consolidated Balance Sheet shows negligible current borrowings (INR 0.06 million).
*   Finance costs primarily relate to lease liabilities.
*   Given the negligible interest-bearing debt, a traditional Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) based on borrowings is not meaningful. The strong OCF provides substantial coverage for lease payments

### Liquidity Position

*   **Liquidity:**
    *   Current Ratio (Consolidated): Improved to 1.99x in FY24 from 1.86x in FY23, indicating strong short-term solvency.
    *   Cash and Bank Balances (Consolidated, including Current Investments): Significant increase to INR 8,830.64 million as of March 31, 2024, from INR 6,236.05 million as of March 31, 2023.
    *   The company maintains a robust liquidity position with substantial cash reserves.
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**  The improving inventory turnover, relatively stable debtor turnover despite high growth, and negative working capital position strongly suggest an efficient, likely negative, cash conversion cycle. This implies the company collects cash from customers before it needs to pay its suppliers, further enhancing liquidity.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield Trends

*   FCF (Consolidated, OCF - Capex): INR 2,318.67 million in FY24 (FY23: INR 1,186.51 million).
*   Market Capitalisation: INR 170.6 billion as of March 31, 2024.
*   FCF Yield (FCF / Market Cap) for FY24: Approx. 1.36% (INR 2,318.67 million / INR 170,600 million).
*   While the yield percentage is modest, the absolute FCF generation is strong and growing, representing ~86% of PAT in FY24. This supports dividends, potential future buybacks, and strategic investments without reliance on debt. The significant increase in FCF from FY23 to FY24 reflects improved operational efficiency and profitability.

## Financial Analysis Report: Triveni Turbine Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   **Opinion:** The Independent Auditors (M/s. Walker Chandiok & Co LLP) issued an *unmodified opinion* on both the Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. They state that the financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Key Audit Matter (KAM):** The auditors identified "Write-downs of inventories to net realisable value" as a Key Audit Matter for both standalone and consolidated audits. This highlights the significant judgment involved in assessing inventory obsolescence, slow movement, and net realizable value, particularly given the nature of the inventory and long product life cycles requiring spares. This KAM does not qualify the opinion on the financial statements.
*   **Qualification on Maintenance of Accounts:** A qualification exists concerning the maintenance of books of account under Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014. The auditors noted that while the accounting software (SAP S/4HANA) has an audit trail (edit log) feature which was operated during the year, this feature was *not enabled at the database level*. This represents a non-compliance with the requirement for a complete audit trail, impacting the verification of data integrity at the database level, although the auditors did not note any instances of tampering where the feature was enabled. (Standalone Auditor's Report Para 17(h)(vii), Consolidated Auditor's Report Para 18(h)(vi), Note 46 Standalone, Note 48 Consolidated).
*   **Other Matter (Consolidated):** The auditors relied on the reports of other auditors for 6 subsidiaries and 1 joint venture for the consolidated financial statements, including conversion adjustments for 5 foreign subsidiaries. This is standard practice and does not qualify the opinion.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   **Basis:** Financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value, in compliance with Ind AS notified under the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from goods sale is recognised at a point in time (control transfer, usually delivery). Service revenue (E&C, O&M) is recognised based on the stage of completion (input/output methods as appropriate). Construction contract revenue uses the percentage-of-completion method based on cost incurred relative to total estimated cost.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value (NRV). Work-in-progress and finished goods cost includes direct costs and allocated indirect costs.
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE):** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives (aligned with Schedule II, with specific lives for certain items like tools/spares).
*   **Intangible Assets:** Stated at cost less accumulated amortization (straight-line over useful lives, e.g., software 3-5 years, designs 6 years, customer relationships/contracts 1-5 years) and impairment.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and corresponding Lease Liabilities are recognised for leases, except short-term and low-value leases which are expensed. ROU assets are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or useful life.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Classified and measured at amortised cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss
