*   Adjustments included depreciation & amortization (Rs. 5,727.93 Lakhs), finance costs (Rs. 552.79 Lakhs), and interest income (Rs. -1,436.39 Lakhs). A significant adjustment relates to the fire incident, with the write-off of assets and recognition of insurance claims recoverable (insurance claim recoverable of Rs. 4,887.15 Lakhs appears as an inflow under investing activities in some formats or impacts working capital).

*   Changes in Working Capital: Net outflow of Rs. 6,249.41 Lakhs, primarily due to an increase in trade receivables (Rs. 5,298.83 Lakhs) and inventories (Rs. 2,797.32 Lakhs), partially offset by an increase in trade payables (Rs. 2,288.03 Lakhs).
*   Cash Generated from Operating Activities: Rs. 19,635.37 Lakhs (FY23: Rs. 19,722.36 Lakhs).

*   **Net Cash used in Investing Activities (ICF): Rs. (6,613.15) Lakhs** (FY23: Rs. 1,103.67 Lakhs inflow). The shift to net outflow is primarily due to increased capex and no large maturity of mutual funds in FY24 compared to FY23.

#### Key Accounting Policies Applied:

*   **Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):** Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer, measured at the transaction price net of variable considerations.
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE):** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over useful lives generally in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Freehold land is not depreciated.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Acquired intangibles (e.g., computer software) are carried at cost less accumulated amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends on classification. Trade receivables follow a lifetime Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Applied using a modified retrospective approach. Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized for most leases, except short-term and low-value asset leases.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (moving weighted average method) or net realizable value.
*   **Foreign Currency Transactions:** Recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets/liabilities are translated at year-end rates. Exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Short-term benefits recognized as incurred. Defined contribution plans (PF, ESI) charged to P&L. Defined benefit plans (Gratuity, Earned Leave) are actuarially valued using the Projected Unit Credit method.
*   **Provisions and Contingent Liabilities:** Provisions recognized for present obligations from past events where an outflow is probable and estimable. Product warranty provisions are based on historical data.
*   **Taxation:** Current tax based on taxable profit. Deferred tax recognized on temporary differences using the balance sheet approach.
*   **Fire Incident Accounting:** Carrying value of damaged PPE and inventories written off. Insurance claim recognized as receivable to the extent recoverable.
