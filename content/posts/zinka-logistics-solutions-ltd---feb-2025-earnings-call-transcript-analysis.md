## Zinka Logistics Solutions Limited (BlackBuck) Q3 FY25 Earnings Analysis

### Financial Performance

BlackBuck reported strong financial results for Q3 FY25, demonstrating significant growth and improving profitability.

#### Key Financial Metrics:

*   **Overall Revenues:** INR 123 crores, a 45% year-on-year (YoY) growth.
*   **Revenue from Continuing Operations:** INR 114 crores, a 41% YoY growth.
*   **Contribution Profit:** INR 115 crores, a 48% YoY growth.
*   **Contribution Margin:** Maintained at a high level of 93%.
*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** INR 42 crores, approximately a 5-fold increase from INR 7.5 crores in Q3 FY24.
*   **Adjusted EBITDA (excluding other income):** INR 33 crores, up from INR 3.4 crores in Q3 FY24 (nearly 10x growth).
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT) (excluding exceptional items):** INR 30 crores, a significant turnaround from a negative INR 6.5 crores in the same quarter last year.
*   **Gross Transaction Value (GTV) - Payments:** INR 6,100 crores, a 35% YoY growth.

#### Comparison with Previous Periods:

*   Consistent sequential growth in Adjusted EBITDA over the last seven quarters, moving from a negative EBITDA margin to 34% in Q3 FY25.
*   Strong YoY growth across all key metrics (revenue, contribution profit, Adjusted EBITDA).

#### Revised Guidance or Forecasts:

*   Management expressed confidence in maintaining the current growth trajectory.
*   Exceptional items (share-based payments, IPO costs) are not expected to recur in coming quarters, which should positively impact reported PAT.

#### Areas of Growth or Decline:

*   **Growth:** Strong growth in core businesses (tolling and GPS, +35% YoY for core) and even faster growth in "growth businesses" (load marketplace, vehicle finance, fuel sensor), which nearly doubled revenue YoY from INR 7 crores to INR 14.5 crores.
*   **Operating Leverage:** A key theme was the strong operating leverage, with a significant portion of revenue growth translating into Adjusted EBITDA growth (91% flow-through YoY for Q3).

### Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

The company is focused on a multi-pronged strategy to capture the trucking ecosystem.

#### Major Strategic Announcements:

*   Continued execution of the three-pronged strategy: Offerings (solving customer problems), Platform (mobile app engagement), and Offline Network (9,000 physical touchpoints for sales and service).
*   Confirmation of revenue visibility for the core FASTag business due to a government notification clarifying the program management fee (MDR) structure.

#### New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed:

*   **Fuel Sensor:** Successfully re-engineered and launched a fuel sensor at a more accessible price point (INR 10,500-11,000), leading to a surge in sales. This is expected to become a major revenue vertical.
*   **Load Marketplace:** Classifieds model showing strong momentum, with break-even targeted for Dec 2025 - Mar 2026. The brokerage model is expanding to more cities.
