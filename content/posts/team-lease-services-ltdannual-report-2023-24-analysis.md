### Key Financial Performance (Consolidated)

| Metric                  | FY24 (INR Crores) | FY23 (INR Crores) | YoY Growth |
| :---------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :--------- |
| Revenue from Operations | 9,321.53          | 7,870.00          | 18.44%     |
| EBITDA (before excep.)  | 130.80            | 122.28            | 7.0%       |
| Profit After Tax (PAT)  | 112.66            | 111.55            | 0.99%      |
| EBITDA Margin           | 1.40%             | 1.55%             | -15 bps    |

*Source: MD's Message, Board's Report Financial Summary, Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, CFO Conversation.*
*Note: EBITDA is as per MD's message and CFO conversation; calculated EBITDA margin based on this.*

#### Observations

*   Revenue demonstrated strong growth at 18.44%, driven primarily by staffing services, particularly in consumer, telecom, retail, e-commerce, and manufacturing sectors due to increased formalization.
*   EBITDA grew by 7.0%, though the EBITDA margin contracted by approximately 15 bps. This margin pressure is attributed to pricing pressures from large clients and macroeconomic headwinds, despite efforts towards economies of scale and value-added services.
*   PAT growth was marginal at 0.99%, indicating that while top-line growth was robust, increased costs or pricing pressures significantly impacted bottom-line expansion.
*   The phase-out of the NEEM program impacted the Degree Apprenticeship business numbers initially but was mitigated by a focus on other apprenticeship schemes, achieving net positive headcount growth by Q4 FY24.
*   IT Staffing continued to face headwinds, mitigated by a strategic shift towards Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and product companies, which offer higher margins albeit lower volumes.

*   **Specialised Staffing Services:** Revenue of ₹551.68 crores in FY24, up 6.60% from ₹517.52 crores in FY23. IT staffing within this segment faced headwinds, mitigated by a strategic focus on Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and product companies, albeit with lower volumes initially.

## TeamLease Services Limited (FY2024) Financial Analysis

Consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at ₹112.66 crores, a marginal increase from ₹111.55 crores in the previous year. Consolidated EBITDA (before exceptional/non-business expense) was ₹130.80 crores, up 7.0% year-over-year from ₹122.28 crores.

The company experienced pressure on margins. The MD's message indicated an approximate 1% reduction in overall margins. Calculated EBITDA margin for FY24 is approximately 1.40% (₹130.80 Cr / ₹9,321.53 Cr), compared to approximately 1.55% in FY23 (₹122.28 Cr / ₹7,870.00 Cr). PAT margin for FY24 was approximately 1.21% (₹112.66 Cr / ₹9,321.53 Cr), down from approximately 1.42% in FY23.

### Market Position and Competitive Landscape

TeamLease positions itself as one of India's leading human resource service companies, having facilitated employment for over 2.3 million individuals since its inception. The company aims to be the largest private sector employer in India and the largest staffing company globally by headcount. Key value drivers include a base of 3,20,000 associates/trainees and over 3,800 clients.

The staffing industry, particularly general staffing, is seeing growth driven by formalization in sectors like consumer and manufacturing. However, this growth, especially with large clients, exerts pressure on Per Associate Per Month (PAPM) revenue and consequently, margins. The IT staffing segment continues to face headwinds from the broader IT industry slowdown, mitigated by a strategic focus on Global Capability Centres (GCCs). The company faces competition from regional players in blue-collar staffing and emerging digital-first staffing platforms.

### Performance of Key Products and Services

#### General Staffing

This segment was the predominant driver of headcount growth, with a net incremental associate growth of approximately 35,000 (20% YoY net growth). Strong performance was noted in consumer, telecom, retail, e-commerce, and manufacturing sectors. The company is focusing on economies of scale, value-added services, and a strategic client mix, including a shift towards variable mark-up models with new, smaller clients to sustain margins. Hiring costs are approximately ₹2,200 per associate.

#### Specialised Staffing (IT & Telecom)

The IT staffing business was impacted by industry headwinds, losing 50% of associate headcount on the IT services side. However, a focus on higher-margin GCC clients helped maintain revenue run-rates. Measures include headcount rationalization and cost optimization, with a goal to recover to an 8% EBITDA margin.

Consolidated EBITDA (before exceptional/non-business expense) grew by 7% YoY to ₹131 crores. However, overall margins experienced a reduction of approximately 1%. Consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at ₹112.66 crores, a marginal increase from ₹111.55 crores in FY23. The company maintained healthy balance sheet metrics with free cash flow of ₹265 crores and a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 36%. Standalone performance also showed growth, with Revenue from Operations increasing to ₹8,440.80 crores from ₹6,876.17 crores and PAT rising to ₹105.80 crores from ₹97.20 crores.

### Long-Term Strategic Goals and Progress

The company's overarching vision is "Putting India to Work," aiming to become India's largest private-sector employer and the world's largest staffing company by headcount. Progress is centered around the "3Es": Employment, Employability, and E-workforce.

#### Employment (Staffing)

General staffing headcount grew 23% YoY in gross revenue terms. Total headcount increased by approximately 37,000 employees in FY24. Strong performance was noted in consumer, telecom, retail, e-commerce, and manufacturing sectors, driven by formalization trends. The IT staffing business faced headwinds but mitigated this by focusing on Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and product companies, securing higher-margin accounts despite lower volumes.

#### Employability (Skilling & Training)

The Degree Apprenticeship business saw a net positive headcount growth despite the exit of NEEM programmes, by broadening other apprenticeship schemes. TeamLease EdTech expanded partnerships with universities and corporates, launching the Digivarsity platform. TeamLease Skills University continues its degree-linked apprenticeship programs.

## Financial Performance Analysis of TeamLease Services Limited for FY2024

### Overall Consolidated Performance

EBITDA (before exceptional/non-business expense) grew by 7% YoY to ₹131 crores. Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at ₹113 crores, a marginal increase from ₹111.55 crores in the previous year. The company maintained a strong balance sheet with free cash flow of ₹265 crores and a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 36%.

*   Strategic focus included new logo acquisition, with 60% of 142 new sign-ups on a variable mark-up model to sustain margins against future salary inflation.
*   Hiring costs for general staffing are approximately ₹2,200 per associate. Tech investments aim to optimize these costs.

*   Strategic shift towards Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and product companies, which offer higher margins (though lower volumes), helped maintain revenue run-rate.
