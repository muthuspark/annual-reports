All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) and rounded to the nearest million.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Based on the MSWIL Statement of Profit and Loss:

* **Revenue:** INR 83,351 million (This includes Revenue from Operations (INR 83,282 million) and Other Income (INR 69 million).  The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding.)
* **Cost of Revenue:** INR 74,896 million (This is the sum of the individual expense items listed in the statement of profit and loss; Cost of Raw Material Consumed, Changes in Inventories, Employee Benefits Expense, Depreciation Expense, Finance Costs, and Other Expenses)
* **Gross Profit:** INR 8,455 million (Calculated as Revenue - Cost of Revenue. Note this is the same figure shown as Profit Before Tax in the summary.)
* **Operating Expenses:** INR 74,896 million - 8,455 million = INR 66,441 million (This is an indirect calculation; operating expenses are not explicitly listed as a separate line item).  This comprises the Cost of Raw Material Consumed, Changes in Inventories, Employee Benefits Expense, Depreciation Expense, and Other Expenses.
* **Operating Income:** INR 8,455 million (This is the same as Gross Profit as finance costs are not deducted)


All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) and rounded to the nearest million.  The figures may vary slightly depending on rounding practices in different parts of the statement.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Based on the MSWIL financial statements:

* **Net Income (Profit for the year):** INR 6,383 million
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** INR 10,133 million  (Note this figure is derived from the Statement of Profit and Loss by adding back depreciation, interest expense, and taxes to the profit before tax, and subtracting interest income).
* **Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):** INR 1.44
* **Diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share):** INR 1.44 (The same as basic EPS because there are no dilutive potential equity shares.)


All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR).



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on the MSWIL Cash Flow Statement:

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** INR 7,910 million
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** (INR 2,079) million  (The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** (INR 4,522) million (The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow)

All figures are in Indian Rupees (INR) and rounded to the nearest million.  The parentheses around the negative numbers indicate cash outflows.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The MSWIL annual report doesn't explicitly state "Free Cash Flow" as a separate line item.  However, we can calculate an approximation:

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** INR 1,111 million (This is directly stated in the cash flow statement)
* **Dividends Paid:** INR 2,868 million (This is directly stated in the cash flow statement)

To approximate Free Cash Flow (FCF), we can use the following formula:

FCF ≈  Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures

Therefore, an *approximation* of MSWIL's Free Cash Flow would be:

* **Approximated Free Cash Flow:** INR 7,910 million - INR 1,111 million = INR 6,799 million

**Important Note:** This is an approximation.  A precise FCF calculation would require adjustments for changes in working capital not already reflected in the cash flow from operations figure.  Also, the definition of FCF can vary slightly depending on the context.  The report doesn't provide sufficient detail to perform a completely accurate FCF calculation.

### Profitability Ratios
To calculate the profitability ratios for Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL), we need to use the figures from the Statement of Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet.  Remember, all figures are in INR millions unless otherwise noted.


* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100

   Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Revenue = 83,351 - 74,896 = 8,455
   Gross Profit Margin = (8,455 / 83,351) * 100 ≈ 10.1%

* **Operating Profit Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100

   Operating Income =  8,455 (This is considered the operating income because finance costs are not deducted from the gross profit)
   Operating Profit Margin = (8,455 / 83,351) * 100 ≈ 10.1%

* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100

   Net Income = 6,383
   Net Profit Margin = (6,383 / 83,351) * 100 ≈ 7.6%

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100

   Net Income = 6,383
   Average Shareholders' Equity = (13,305 + 16,768) / 2 = 15,036.5
   ROE = (6,383 / 15,036.5) * 100 ≈ 42.4%

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100

   Net Income = 6,383
   Average Total Assets = (28,977 + 31,389) / 2 = 30,183
   ROA = (6,383 / 30,183) * 100 ≈ 21.1%


**Important Note:** These calculations are based on the figures provided in the annual report.  Slight variations may occur due to rounding differences in the report itself.  Furthermore, the calculation of operating income assumes that finance costs are not included in operating expenses; this should be confirmed from the company's accounting practices.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate the liquidity ratios for Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL), we'll use the figures from the Balance Sheet. Remember, all figures are in INR millions.

* **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities

   Current Assets = 23,767
   Current Liabilities = 12,030  (Note: There's a discrepancy between the sum of current liabilities in the detailed breakdown vs. the total provided. We'll use the total of 12,030 for this calculation.  This discrepancy should be noted.)
   Current Ratio = 23,767 / 12,030 ≈ 1.97

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities

   Current Assets = 23,767
   Inventories = 11,399
   Current Liabilities = 12,030
   Quick Ratio = (23,767 - 11,399) / 12,030 ≈ 1.02

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities

   Cash and Cash Equivalents = 1,670
   Current Liabilities = 12,030
   Cash Ratio = 1,670 / 12,030 ≈ 0.14


**Important Notes:**

* All figures are rounded to two decimal places.
* The current ratio is significantly higher than the quick ratio, indicating a substantial portion of current assets is tied up in inventory.
* The cash ratio is low, suggesting that the company may rely more heavily on other current assets to meet short-term obligations.
* As noted previously, there's a discrepancy in the current liabilities figure in the provided balance sheet.  The calculations above use the total current liabilities figure provided (INR 12,030 million), but a more precise calculation may be possible with clarification from the company on this point.


### Efficiency Ratios
To calculate the efficiency ratios for Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL), we'll use figures from the Statement of Profit and Loss and the Balance Sheet.  Remember, all figures are in INR millions.  We'll need to make some assumptions and approximations due to missing information in the provided excerpts.


* **Asset Turnover:** Revenue / Average Total Assets

   Revenue = 83,351
   Average Total Assets = (28,977 + 31,389) / 2 = 30,183
   Asset Turnover = 83,351 / 30,183 ≈ 2.76

* **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory

   Cost of Revenue = 74,896
   Average Inventory = (12,096 + 11,399) / 2 = 11,747.5
   Inventory Turnover = 74,896 / 11,747.5 ≈ 6.37

* **Receivables Turnover:** Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable

   Revenue = 83,351
   Average Accounts Receivable = (8,004 + 8,959) / 2 = 8,481.5
   Receivables Turnover = 83,351 / 8,481.5 ≈ 9.83


**Important Notes:**

* All figures are rounded to two decimal places.
* These calculations are based on the available data in the annual report.  Slight variations might occur depending on the rounding in the original financial statements.  There may also be further refinement needed depending on whether the revenue figure used incorporates other income or only revenue from operations.
* The inventory turnover ratio suggests that the company sells and replaces its inventory approximately 6.37 times per year.  The receivables turnover shows that the company collects its outstanding receivables approximately 9.83 times per year, which correlates with the average collection period (days) of 37 days as reported.  The asset turnover indicates that the company generates INR 2.76 in revenue for every INR 1 in total assets.  These metrics would need further comparison to industry benchmarks for more meaningful analysis.



### Leverage Ratios
To calculate the leverage ratios for Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL), we'll use figures from the Balance Sheet and the Statement of Profit and Loss.  All figures are in INR millions.

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity

   Total Debt =  Long-term debt + Current portion of Lease Liabilities = 86 + 737 = 823 (Note: This calculation uses the figures from the balance sheet. The definition of total debt might be different in the company's accounting practices, depending on inclusion/exclusion of other liabilities. Also note the earlier discrepancy in current liabilities reporting should be investigated for accuracy)
   Shareholders' Equity = 16,768
   Debt-to-Equity Ratio = 823 / 16,768 ≈ 0.05

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets

   Total Debt = 823
   Total Assets = 31,389
   Debt-to-Assets Ratio = 823 / 31,389 ≈ 0.03

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** EBITDA / Interest Expense

   EBITDA = 10,133
   Interest Expense = 273 (This is the net finance cost as reported in the statement of profit and loss. It excludes interest income and should be adjusted to only include interest expense)
   Interest Coverage Ratio = 10,133 / 273 ≈ 37.11


**Important Notes:**

* All figures are rounded to two decimal places.
* There is ambiguity in the balance sheet in relation to total debt. It lists total lease liability separately. The calculations above use the figures listed as "Borrowings", as per the balance sheet. This should be clarified from the company's accounting practices.  The definition of "Total Debt" can vary significantly depending on what liabilities are included (e.g., lease obligations, etc.) therefore requiring clarification.
* A higher interest coverage ratio is generally preferred, indicating the company's ability to easily meet its interest obligations.
* The low debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios suggest that the company has a conservative capital structure with low reliance on debt financing.  This should be compared to industry benchmarks for a more complete interpretation.





## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided annual report does *not* contain information on market capitalization, Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, Price-to-Book (PB) ratio, or dividend yield. These are market-based metrics that depend on the current market price of the company's stock, which isn't included in the report.

The only market-related information provided is the scrip codes (MSUMI and 543498) and historical high/low stock prices for the previous year.  To calculate the market-based ratios, you would need the current market price of MSWIL's stock and the number of outstanding shares.

The annual report *does* provide the following:


* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** 55%  (This is the percentage of net income paid out as dividends.)

To obtain the market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield, you'd need to consult a financial website (such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, etc.) that tracks stock market data for MSWIL.  You'll need the current market price per share and the number of outstanding shares to calculate the market cap.  Then you would use the reported earnings per share and book value per share, along with the current market price and dividend per share to calculate the other ratios.





## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The MSWIL annual report does not provide a detailed breakdown of business segments with precise revenue figures, growth rates, operating margins, and market shares for each segment.  The report offers a general overview of revenue distribution by vehicle type, but doesn't provide segment-specific profitability or market share data.  This limits the ability to perform a thorough analysis on a segment-by-segment basis.


Here's a summary based on the information available:

**Business Segments (by Vehicle Type):**

The report categorizes MSWIL's business based on the type of vehicle the wiring harnesses are supplied for.  While these are not formally defined as separate segments for accounting purposes (the report indicates that only one segment is reported), they provide a useful classification:

Key products are wiring harnesses of varying complexity, tailored to different models and features (including advanced safety and infotainment systems). The growth is driven by the overall growth in the Indian passenger vehicle market, especially SUVs, and the trend of premiumization.  Specific revenue, growth rate, operating margin, and market share are not provided.

* **Commercial Vehicles (CVs):** This segment represents 12% of revenue.  Products include wiring harnesses for buses and light-duty trucks.  The growth rate, margin and market share are not detailed.

* **Two-Wheelers (2Ws):** This segment constitutes 14% of revenue, supplying wiring harnesses to two-wheeler manufacturers. Again, more detailed segment data is not presented.

* **O/ff-Road & Agricultural Vehicles:** This segment accounts for 10% of revenue, providing wiring harnesses for specialized vehicles.  The report does not provide further segment data.

* **Others:** This category includes 6% of revenue, encompassing sales to other Tier 1/2 suppliers or other miscellaneous business areas.  Details are absent.


**Missing Information:**

The report lacks crucial data for a complete segment analysis:

* **Precise Revenue Figures:** Only the overall revenue distribution percentages by vehicle type are provided;  exact revenue figures for each category aren't given.
* **Growth Rates:** Year-on-year growth rates for each segment are not disclosed.
* **Operating Margins:**  Profitability (operating margins) for individual segments is not reported.
* **Market Shares:** The company's market share in each of these vehicle segments is not provided.
* **Geographic Presence:** While the report mentions that MSWIL has 26 plants across India, it doesn't break down the geographic distribution of these facilities among the segments.


**Conclusion:**

Without detailed segmental financial data, a precise analysis of MSWIL's performance across di/fferent vehicle categories is impossible based solely on the provided report. The available information only gives a high-level overview of revenue distribution but lacks essential metrics to evaluate individual segment performance and profitability.

### Audit Information
**Auditor's Opinion:**

The auditor's opinion, provided by S.R. Batliboi & Co. LLP, is unqualified (i.e., a clean opinion).  The auditors stated that the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India, of the Company's financial position, financial performance (including other comprehensive income), cash flows, and changes in equity.  The report also includes a section on key audit matters, focusing on the significance of related-party transactions and the judgements involved in their assessment. A separate report was issued on the internal financial controls, which also received an unqualified opinion.


**Key Accounting Policies:**

Several key accounting policies are highlighted in the notes to the financial statements:


* **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of goods or services transfers to the customer.  The company assesses whether it is acting as a principal or an agent in each transaction, impacting how revenue is recognized (gross vs. net).  Judgements are applied regarding the lease term, significant financing components in contracts, variable consideration (rights of return, volume rebates), and warranty obligations.

* **Financial Instruments:**  Financial assets are classified and measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) based on the business model and cash flow characteristics.  The expected credit loss (ECL) model is used for impairment of financial assets.  Financial liabilities are classified similarly and measured at amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss.

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** PP&E is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's useful life.

* **Borrowing Costs:** Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalized; others are expensed.

* **Inventories:** Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using a weighted average cost method.

* **Government Grants:**  Recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions.  Grants related to income are deferred and recognized over the related period; grants related to assets are recognized in profit or loss over the asset's useful life.

* **Leases:** The company follows Ind AS 116, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases except short-term and low-value leases.

* **Employee Benefits:** Short-term benefits are recognized at the expected cost at the end of the reporting period; defined contribution plans are expensed when contributions are made; defined benefit plans use actuarial valuations, with remeasurements going to OCI.

* **Income Taxes:** The Company uses the liability method for deferred tax, recognizing assets and liabilities when it is probable that future taxable profit or loss will arise.  Current tax liabilities are based on tax rates at the end of the reporting period.

* **Fair Value Measurement:**  The company uses a three-level hierarchy to categorize fair value measurements (Level 1: quoted prices; Level 2: observable inputs; Level 3: unobservable inputs).

These are some of the key accounting policies. The notes to the financial statements contain more detail on these and other accounting policies.
