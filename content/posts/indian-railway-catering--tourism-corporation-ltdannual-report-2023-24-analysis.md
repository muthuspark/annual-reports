### Working Capital Trends

The working capital trends can be analyzed using the current ratio:

| Year      | Current Assets (INR Lakhs) | Current Liabilities (INR Lakhs) | Current Ratio |
| :-------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------- | :------------ |
| 2023-24   | 5,14,416.99              | 2,63,167.42                      | 1.95          |
| 2022-23   | 4,35,181.76              | 2,39,136.54                      | 1.82          |
| 2021-22   | 276,439.02               | 1,38,604.47                      | 1.99         |

#### Analysis

*   The current ratio has been relatively stable at around 1.82 to 1.95 during the periods, indicating a good ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets.

### Asset Quality Metrics

Due to the nature of IRCTC's business (service-oriented and a government enterprise), traditional asset quality metrics like Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) – common for banks – are not directly applicable. But one metric to consider is the allowance for Doubtful debts.

From the Annual Report (Note 10.1, Trade Receivables):

| Particulars                             | 31-Mar-2024 | 31-Mar-2023 |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Trade Receivables-credit impaired       | 15,377.80   | 14,343.61   |
| Less: Allowance for Doubtful Debts      | (14,510.26) | (13,924.76) |
| **Net Impaired Receivables**            | **867.54**  | **418.85**  |

#### Analysis

*   There is a rise in impaired trade receivables between periods.

### Debt Structure and Maturity Profile

Based on the provided information, IRCTC's debt primarily consists of lease liabilities.

#### Lease Liabilities (INR Lakhs)

| Maturity Profile           | 31-Mar-2024 | 31-Mar-2023 |
| :------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Current (Less than 1 year) | 1,855.31    | 2,471.11    |
| Non-Current                | 4,179.74    | 5,945.11    |
| **Total Lease Liabilities**| **6,035.05**| **8,416.22**|

#### Analysis

*   IRCTC has a mix of short-term and long-term lease liabilities.

### Off-Balance Sheet Items

The main item to consider here is **Contingent Liabilities**. The report mentions a significant amount of INR 23,057.04 lakhs as contingent liabilities as on March 31, 2024 (Note 37.2). These represent potential obligations that are not yet recognized on the balance sheet but could have a material impact.

### Industry Benchmark Comparisons

Making direct comparisons is challenging without precise data on competitors in each segment. However, general observations can be made:

*   **Profitability:** IRCTC's profitability needs to be benchmarked against other catering, tourism, and online ticketing companies (if publicly available data exists).
*   **Current Ratio:** A current ratio of close to 2 is generally considered healthy, but the ideal benchmark depends on the specific industry. Comparing this to other railway service providers or large e-commerce platforms would provide more context.
*   **Debt Levels:** IRCTC's debt primarily relates to lease liabilities. A comparison with other companies that have substantial lease obligations (e.g., airlines, retail chains) would be useful.
