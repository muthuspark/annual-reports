#### Analysis

Consolidated revenue shows consistent growth over the three years. Standalone revenue also grew. Profitability metrics (PBT, PAT, EBITDA) showed an increase from FY22 to FY23, with a mixed performance in FY24; Consolidated PBT and Operating Profit Margin decreased, while PAT increased. Standalone PBT, EBITDA, and margins saw a decrease in FY24 compared to FY23, though PAT increased. The decrease in profitability in FY24 is partly attributed to provisions made for a customer undergoing preventive restructuring. Debt-Equity ratios remain low for both consolidated and standalone entities, indicating a healthy leverage position.
