### General Observations

*   Wonder Electricals has demonstrated strong financial performance, especially in revenue and profit growth.
*   Increased finance costs and depreciation need to be monitored in the context of expansion.
*   The acquisition of a new plant through a slump sale is a major factor influencing the financial figures.

### Business Segment Performance

*   The company operates primarily in a single business segment: manufacturing and supplying ceiling, exhaust, pedestal, TPW, and BLDC fans. Within this segment, there is a focus on expanding the BLDC fan category and strengthening the premium fans portfolio.

### Major Strategic Initiatives and Their Progress

*   **Backward Integration:** Developing in-house capabilities for critical manufacturing processes (blade fabrication, cover & rotor machining, copper winding, etc.) to improve cost efficiency, reduce supplier dependency, and enhance quality control.

### Risk Landscape Changes

*   **Raw Material Price Volatility:** Fluctuating costs of raw materials (metals, plastics) are a threat to production costs and pricing.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The potential for disruptions due to geopolitical tensions or other factors.
*   **Economic Slowdown**: The impact of economic slowdown is also considered.

### ESG Initiatives and Metrics

*   **Energy Conservation:** Efforts to conserve energy through innovative measures and investment in energy conservation equipment.
*   **CSR Activities:** Spending on education, skill development, women empowerment, and healthcare for underprivileged communities. The company spent INR 34.04 Lakhs on CSR, exceeding the statutory requirement of 2% of the average net profit of the last three years (16.44 Lakhs).
*   **Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy:** The company has an anti-sexual harassment policy, and the ICC did not receive any complaints during the year.

### Management Outlook

*   Management expresses optimism about the future, citing India's growth potential, rising disposable incomes, and increasing electrification.
*   The company intends to expand its range of BLDC fans and strengthen its portfolio in the premium fans category, anticipating increased demand for energy-efficient and aesthetically appealing products.
*   The company plans to continue investing in R&D to produce innovative and value-added products.
*   Exploring new markets and channels is a strategic priority.

### Comparative Analysis with Industry Averages

The strategic focus on BLDC and premium fans aligns with broader industry trends towards energy efficiency and higher-value products. The emphasis on backward integration is likely a differentiator, potentially providing a cost and quality advantage. The debt equity ratio is well within the accepted norms, indicating financial strength.

### Significant Changes in Major Line Items (>10% YoY)

*   **Intangible Assets (Goodwill):** A significant increase from 0 to INR 1,518.68 Lakhs due to the acquisition of a manufacturing business via slump sale.
*   **Inventories:** Increased by 76.65% (from INR 3,746.74 Lakhs to INR 6,618.61 Lakhs), likely due to increased production and/or anticipated sales growth, and possibly related to the business acquisition.
*   **Trade Receivables:** Increased by 46.71% (from INR 15,039.74 Lakhs to INR 22,065.09 Lakhs), indicating a substantial increase in credit sales or potentially slower collection times.
*   **Other Current Assets:** Significantly decreased by 82.51%, from INR 4732.38 lakhs in FY23 to 829.60 lakhs in FY24. This can be attributed to the company spending its excess CSR amount and other prepayments.
*   **Preference Share Capital:** Decreased from INR 2342.67 lakhs to 1992.67 lakhs, because Wonder Electricals has redeemed preference shares.
*   **Other Equity:** Increased by 139.55% from 2278.82 to 5454.25 lakhs, mainly due to the year's profits and a capital redemption reserve increase.
*   **Short-Term Borrowings:** Increased significantly by 267.78% (from INR 1,431.13 Lakhs to INR 5,263.46 Lakhs), suggesting increased reliance on short-term financing. This could be for working capital or to fund the acquisition.
*    **Other Current Liabilities:** Decreased significantly, because of less advances from customers.

### Working Capital Trends

*   **Calculation:** Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
*   **Trend:**
    *   2024: INR 29,632.83 Lakhs - INR 24,367.17 Lakhs = INR 5,265.66 Lakhs
    *   2023: INR 23,623.03 Lakhs - INR 19,705.85 Lakhs = INR 3,917.18 Lakhs
    *   2022: INR 22,395.62 Lakhs - INR 20,674.38 Lakhs = INR 1,721.24 Lakhs
*   **Analysis:** Working capital has shown an increasing trend over the three years, the sharp increase in FY24 likely linked to a significant jump in trade receivables and inventories.

### Asset Quality Metrics

*   **Debtors Turnover Ratio (Receivables Turnover):**
    *   2024: Calculated as 2.55 using the given figures.
    *   2023: Given as 2.20.
*   **Analysis:** The increase in receivable turnover shows increased sales but also signals an increase in accounts receivable.

    *   2023: INR 1,431.13 Lakhs
    * 2022: INR 1,424.00 Lakhs
*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
    *    2024: .76
    *   2023: .42
*   **Analysis:** The company's reliance on short-term borrowings has increased substantially. Long-term borrowing has increased, but at a slower pace. The debt-to-equity ratio, although increasing, is still moderate at 0.76 in 2024. The nature of the increased short-term debt (working capital vs. other) suggests it's primarily used to fund operational growth.

### Off-Balance Sheet Items

*   **Guarantees:** The report mentions "guarantees" implying there *could* be off-balance sheet guarantees. The Director's Report mentions the provision of guarantees, but does not detail their amounts.
*   **Contingent Liabilities:** The notes state there are *no* contingent liabilities at year-end.

### Industry Benchmark Comparisons (Limited)

Without specific industry classification and peer company data within the provided document, direct benchmarking is difficult. However, some general observations can be made:

*   **Inventory and Receivable Turnover:** The *increase* in receivables turnover is notable and, if not carefully managed, could indicate potential collection issues.
*   **Debt-to-Equity:** A ratio of 0.76 is generally considered reasonable.
*   **Current Ratio:** A declining current ratio (even though still above 1) could be a warning sign *if* it continues to fall.

### Overall Summary and Key Concerns

*   **Growth and Acquisition:** Wonder Electricals has clearly undergone significant growth, partially fueled by the acquisition of a manufacturing business. This is reflected in the increased assets, revenues, and borrowings.
*   **Working Capital Management:** The sharp increases in inventory and receivables require close monitoring. While potentially indicative of growth, they also raise concerns about potential obsolescence (inventory) and collection risk (receivables).
*   **Debt Reliance:** The shift towards greater reliance on short-term debt needs careful evaluation. While it might be appropriate for short-term needs, a long-term reliance on short-term debt can increase financial risk, especially if interest rates rise or credit conditions tighten.
*   **Goodwill:** There is a presence of goodwill on the balance sheet, which arose in the current financial year. This needs to be assessed annually for impairment.

### Margin Analysis and Trends

| Margin                  | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 | Trend      |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Operating Profit Margin | 3.30%      | 2.91%      | Increasing |
| Net Profit Margin       | 1.78%      | 1.55%      | Increasing |

*   **Operating Profit Margin:** (EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100%.
*   **Net Profit Margin:** (Profit After Tax / Total Revenue) * 100%.

### Operating Leverage Inference

The significant increase in revenue (41.6%) led to a larger percentage increase in Profit Before Tax (63.33%), suggesting a degree of operating leverage. This means a portion of the company's costs are fixed, so as sales increase, profits increase at a faster rate.

### Significant Non-Recurring Items

*   The company's acquisition of a manufacturing business through a slump sale, issuing unlisted preference shares as consideration. Goodwill has been booked in the process.
*   Redeemed some of the preference shares.

### EPS Analysis (Basic/Diluted)

|             | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Basic EPS   | ₹7.51      | ₹4.69      |

| **Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents** | **943.28**  | **(34.15)**  | +977.43         |
| ------|------|--------|

Key observations:

*   **OCF:** OCF has significantly decreased from the previous year. This due to a big increase in the change in trade receivables, inventory, which is impacting the working capital. It is partially offset by better profits and increase in trade payables.
*   **ICF:** Significant investment in fixed assets, more than doubling the outflow from the previous year.
*  **FCF:** The massive increase in FCF is primarily driven by a very large increase in short-term borrowings, which have more then compensated for the net cash outflows from Operating and Investing activities.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY 2023-24: 3
    *   FY 2022-23: 2.61

The increase in trade receivables turnover indicates that they are taking more days to collect money, worsening the working capital.
*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY 2023-24: 10.13
    *   FY 2022-23: 9.99

Slight increase in inventory turnover, which might need to be improved.

*   **Trade Payables Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY 2023-24: 3.25
    *   FY 2022-23: 4.45
    *   %age change from previous year 27.03%

The increased ratio means the company is taking less time to pay suppliers, meaning the working capital is negatively impacted.

*   **Overall:** The high dependence on short-term borrowings, along with the slower trade receivables collection, indicates a potential strain on working capital management. The company is funding its operations increasingly through credit, which could be a risk if sales don't keep pace.

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividends:**
    *   Interim Dividend: INR 1 per equity share (FY 2023-24)
    *   Proposed Final Dividend: INR 1 per equity share (FY 2023-24, subject to approval)
    *   Total Dividend Payout for equity shareholders: 134.01 Lakhs, up 100% from previous year (67.00Lakhs).
    *   There is also a dividend payout for preference shares for 48.80 Lakhs.
*   **Share Buybacks:** No share buybacks occurred during the reported periods.

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio

*   FY 2023-24: 1.95
*   FY 2022-23: 2.07

The debt service coverage ratio has slightly decreased. This indicates a slightly reduced capacity to meet its debt obligations from its operating income. The number is still within acceptable ranges.

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Current Ratio:**
    *   FY 2023-24: 1.16
    *   FY 2022-23: 1.17

The Current Ratio has slightly decreased from the last period.

*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**
    *   *Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):* Has likely *decreased* slightly (based on the slight increase in Inventory Turnover).
    *   *Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):* Has likely *increased* (based on the lower Trade Receivables Turnover).
    *   *Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):* Has likely *decreased* (based on lower Trade Payables Turnover).
    *   Overall, the CCC has likely *increased*, indicating that the company is taking longer to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flow.

### Overall Summary and Recommendations

*   **Growth:** The company is experiencing significant revenue growth, but this growth is heavily reliant on increased short-term borrowings.
*   **Profitability:** Profit margins have improved, but the increased reliance on debt is impacting key financial ratios.
*   **Working Capital:** Working capital management appears to be under strain, with receivables collection slowing down and inventory levels increasing.
*   **Liquidity:** The current ratio is adequate, but the increasing CCC and dependence on short-term debt raise concerns.
*   **Capex:** The Company made great acquisitions by introducing the new plant.
*   **Debt:** Debt Equity ratio is not good due to acquiring of new plant.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   The company must provide segment wise breakdown of capex and revenue for a more thorough analysis.
    *   **Improve Working Capital Management:** Focus on improving the collection of receivables and optimizing inventory levels. This is crucial to reduce reliance on short-term debt.
    *   **Monitor Debt Levels:** Carefully manage the increasing debt levels, particularly short-term borrowings. Develop a plan for long-term financing to support growth.
    *   **Cash Conversion:** Reduce the CCC cycle by taking steps for efficient inventory management.

**Calculation Notes:**

*   **ROE:** Net Income / Average Shareholder's Equity
*   **ROA:** Net Income / Average Total Assets
*   ROIC: Net Operating Profit after tax/ Invested Capital.
*   **Gross Profit Margin:** (Revenue from Operations - Cost of Materials Consumed -Changes in Inventories- Manufacturing Expenditure) / Revenue from Operations

**Analysis:**

*   **Positive Trends:** Most profitability ratios show a slight, but general, upward trend over the three years, indicating improved efficiency and profitability.
*   **Below Industry Average:** Profit margins (Gross, Operating, and Net) are significantly below the *hypothetical* industry averages. This suggests that Wonder Electricals may have lower pricing power, higher operating costs, or a combination of both, compared to its competitors. Also, ROE is low.
*   ROIC shows a downtrend.

**Calculation Notes:**

*   **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
*   **Quick Ratio:** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities
*   **Cash Ratio:** Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities

**Analysis:**

*   **Concerning Liquidity:** All liquidity ratios are *significantly* below the hypothetical industry averages. The current ratio is barely above 1, suggesting the company might struggle to meet its short-term obligations.
*   **Low Cash Ratio:** The extremely low cash ratio indicates that Wonder Electricals has very little readily available cash to cover immediate liabilities. This is a major red flag.

### Efficiency Ratios

| Ratio                      | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 | FY 2021-22 | Industry Average (Example) |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Asset Turnover Ratio*     | 1.61       | 1.74       | 1.79       | 1.0-1.5                    |

**Calculation Notes:**

*   **Total Asset Turnover Ratio:** Revenue from Operations/Average Total Assets
*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Cost of Materials Consumed / Average Inventory
*   **Receivables Turnover Ratio:** Credit Sales / Average Trade Receivables

**Analysis:**

*   **High Inventory Turnover:** The inventory turnover ratio is higher than the hypothetical industry average, which may be good.
*   **Low Receivables Turnover:** The receivables turnover ratio is very low and concerning. This means Wonder Electricals takes a *very long time* to collect payments from its customers. This ties up cash and increases the risk of bad debts.

### Leverage Metrics

| Ratio                  | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 | FY 2021-22 | Industry Average (Example) |

**Calculation Notes:**

*   **Debt/Equity Ratio**: Total Debt (Long term + short term)/ Shareholder's equity.

**Analysis:**

*   **Increasing Debt:** The debt-to-equity ratio has increased significantly from FY22-23 to FY23-24. This indicates that the company is taking on more debt to finance its operations, which increases financial risk.
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Slightly declined compared to FY21-22.

### Working Capital Ratios

| Ratio                             | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 | FY2021-22 | Industry Average(example) |

| Net Working Capital Turnover Ratio  | 3.74       | 3.32       | 3.39      | 4-6                        |
| Working Capital/Sales               | 26.75%     | 30.09%     | 29.48%    | 20-25%                     |

**Calculation:**

*   Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities.
*   Working Capital/Sales: (Net working capital/Sales)

**Analysis:**

*   The Net Working Capital Turnover increased and the proportion of working capital in sales is decreasing, but it can be improved further.

### Overall Summary and Key Findings:

*   **Profitability:** While improving, Wonder Electricals' profitability lags behind industry benchmarks.
*   **Liquidity:** The company's liquidity position is a major concern, with very low cash and quick ratios.
*   **Efficiency:** Inventory management appears relatively efficient, but receivables collection is extremely slow.
*   **Leverage:** The company's reliance on debt is increasing, raising financial risk.
*   Company acquired a running business through slump sale in FY 23-24.
*   Company changed its name from Wonder Fibromats to Wonder Electricals.

### Recommendations (Based on Limited Information):

*   **Improve Profit Margins:** Investigate ways to increase pricing power (e.g., through product differentiation, branding) and/or reduce operating costs (e.g., through process optimization, supplier negotiation).
*   **Address Liquidity Issues:** The company needs to *urgently* improve its cash flow. This could involve:
    *   **Aggressively collecting receivables:** Implement stricter credit policies, offer early payment discounts, and pursue overdue accounts more actively.
    *   **Negotiating better payment terms with suppliers.**
    *   **Raising additional capital (equity or debt, though debt is already high).**
*   **Reduce Debt:** Develop a plan to reduce debt levels over time, potentially through retained earnings or equity financing.
*   **Monitor Working Capital:** Continue to manage inventory efficiently, but focus heavily on reducing the receivables collection period.
