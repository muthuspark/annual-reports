## Laurus Labs Limited: FY2024 Performance Analysis

### Financial Performance (3-Year Trend Analysis)

*   **FY2024 Overview:** Laurus Labs reported consolidated revenue from operations of ₹5,041 crore, a 17% decline from ₹6,041 crore in FY23. This decline was primarily attributed to the completion of a large Purchase Order (PO) supply in FY23. Excluding this PO, core business revenue grew by 9%. EBITDA stood at ₹798 crore (15.8% margin), a 50% decrease from ₹1,594 crore (26.4% margin) in FY23, impacted by lower asset utilisation and upfront costs for growth projects. Profit After Tax (PAT) was ₹161 crore, down 80% from ₹790 crore in FY23. Gross margin remained relatively resilient at 51.7% (vs. 54.1% in FY23).
*   **Trend Analysis (Primarily FY24 vs. FY23):** The provided data indicates a significant contraction in key financial metrics (Net Sales, EBITDA, PAT, EPS, ROCE, ROE) in FY24 compared to FY23, largely due to the high base effect of the FY23 PO. The dividend payout ratio was maintained at 19% (₹0.80 per share total interim dividend declared for FY24). Net worth saw a modest increase to ₹4,111 crore from ₹4,038 crore. The Debt-Equity ratio increased to 0.61 from 0.49, reflecting increased borrowings (total debt ₹2,507 crore vs. ₹1,972 crore) primarily to fund growth capex. 

### Business Segment Performance (FY2024)

*   **Generics API:** Revenue declined by 2% YoY to ₹2,545 crore. ARV API revenue was steady (+1%), and Oncology API saw strong demand (+27%). However, the non-ARV/non-oncology segment declined by 22% due to lower demand and competitive pricing pressures. Focus remains on leveraging large-scale capacity and expanding market share.
*   **Generics FDF:** Revenue grew strongly by 24% YoY to ₹1,414 crore, driven by stabilizing ARV business, volume growth in developed markets, and increased CMO activity. The JV with KRKA is expected to enhance the portfolio and market presence. 8 product dossiers were filed, and 9 approvals received.
*   **CDMO - Synthesis:** Core business (excluding the large FY23 PO) grew by 24% YoY to ₹922 crore. Performance was driven by increased RFPs, progress on late-phase NCE projects, and a new multi-year MSA with a crop protection company. Animal Health DS validation commenced.
*   **Biotechnology:** Revenue increased by 28% YoY to ₹160 crore, led by CDMO services leveraging biocatalysis expertise. R-2 downstream debottlenecking was completed. Investment in a new microbial fermentation facility in Vizag commenced.

### Major Strategic Initiatives and Progress (FY2024)

*   **Innovation & R&D:** R&D spend was 4.8% of revenue (₹241 crore). Launched NexCAR19 (India's first CAR-T therapy via associate ImmunoACT). Increased stake in ImmunoACT (to ~34%) and Laurus Bio (to 87.58%). In-licensed 4 gene therapy assets from IIT-Kanpur and initiated construction of a GMP facility. Advanced ODF technology (US FDA approval for paediatric DTG) and sterile injectable platforms. Expanded biocatalysis and flow chemistry projects.
*   **Expansion & Capacity Building:** Invested ₹700 crore in capex, largely for CDMO/API capabilities. Commissioned two GMP production plants for Animal Health. A new dedicated R&D center (small molecules/high potent) is set for commissioning in Q2 FY25. Commenced construction of a $40 million microbial fermentation facility in Vizag. Doubled Drug Product capacity to 10 bn units/year. API capacity increased by 30% over 24 months to 7.75 ML KL.
*   **Partnerships & Market Development:** Secured a multi-year CDMO MSA with a leading crop science company. Formed a 51:49 JV (Krka Pharma Pvt. Ltd.) with KRKA (Slovenia) with up to €50 million phased investment for FDF manufacturing and market expansion. Deepened cooperation with major CDMO clients on green/sustainable platforms. Served 6 out of the top 10 global innovators.

### Risk Landscape

*   **Key Risks:** The company identifies operational (capacity planning, EHS), strategic (industry downturn, competition, innovation lag), financial (forex fluctuations), and compliance (regulatory changes/approvals) risks.
*   **FY24 Context:** The year highlighted sensitivity to ARV pricing pressure and competitive intensity in the generics space. Supply chain de-risking due to geopolitical factors presents both risk and opportunity. Delays in regulatory approvals or partner clinical programs remain potential threats. Forex risk is managed via hedging.
*   **Mitigation:** Strategies include capacity monitoring, safety programs (SANKALP), BCP development, market diversification, economies of scale, R&D investment for niche products/process efficiency (flow chemistry, biocatalysis), cost reduction initiatives, and robust compliance systems. The risk management framework involves Board oversight via dedicated committees (Risk Management, Audit).

### ESG Initiatives and Metrics (FY2024)

*   **Environmental:** Consumed 9% renewable energy (primarily solar). Recycled 284,801 KL water. Total energy consumption was 3,469,230 GJ. Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions were reported as 198,782 tCO2e, 176,678 tCO2e, and 87,212 tCO2e respectively. Recycled/reused 22,884 tonnes of waste. Key initiatives included waste heat recovery, VFDs, temperature controls, movement sensors, and EV transition. Committed to SBTi. All sites ISO 14001 certified.
*   **Social:** Employed 6,735 permanent staff (7.5% women). Achieved Zero Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIFR). Invested ₹23.31 crore in CSR across 25+ community programs (health, education, environment, skills). Certified as a Great Place to Work (5th consecutive year). 64,977 hours spent on H&S training. Implemented SANKALP safety initiative. All sites ISO 45001 certified.
*   **Governance:** Maintained Board independence at 57% (exceeding mandate). 14% women directors. Rated 'BBB' by MSCI ESG, Silver by EcoVadis, and improved S&P Global ESG Score to 59. Robust Code of Conduct, Whistleblower Policy, and grievance mechanisms are in place. 100% employees trained on Code of Conduct.

### Management Outlook (FY2025)

*   Management expects robust growth in FY25, focusing on unlocking sustainable and profitable growth through enhanced technology breadth and commercial excellence.
*   Key priorities include improving operating margins via better asset utilization and productivity gains, delivering on late-phase commercial NCE opportunities within CDMO, and scaling up growth projects.
*   Anticipated API pricing headwinds are expected to be offset by volume increases and cost improvements.
*   Strategic capex will continue, prioritising high-value segments and enhancing scientific capabilities (e.g., new R&D center, Vizag fermentation facility).
*   The KRKA JV and Crop Science MSA are expected to contribute to diversification and growth.
*   Continued focus on scaling Animal Health and AgChem CDMO businesses.
*   Commitment to advancing Cell and Gene Therapy initiatives (NexCAR19 expansion, IIT-Kanpur facility).

*Analysis:* Net Working Capital decreased significantly by ₹336.66 Cr in FY24. This was primarily driven by a substantial increase in Trade Payables (+₹340.59 Cr) and Current Borrowings (+₹207.21 Cr), which more than offset the increase in Inventories (+₹159.82 Cr) and Trade Receivables (+₹86.73 Cr). The Cash Conversion Cycle improved, reducing from 97 days to 89 days, mainly due to the extension of payable days, despite increases in inventory and receivable holding periods.

*   **Consolidated Revenue:** Decreased by 17% YoY to ₹5,041 crores in FY24 from ₹6,041 crores in FY23, primarily due to the completion of a large Purchase Order (PO) supply in FY23. Excluding the impact of this large PO, core business revenue grew by 9% YoY.
*   **Segment Performance (YoY Growth excluding FY23 PO impact where applicable):**
    *   **Generics FDF:** Grew strongly by 24% YoY to ₹1,414 crores, driven by stabilising ARV business and volume growth in developed markets.
    *   **CDMO - Synthesis:** Core business grew by 24% YoY to ₹922 crores, supported by strong RFP flow and new customer engagements, including a multi-year MSA with a crop science company.
    *   **Biotechnology:** Increased by 28% YoY to ₹160 crores, driven by CDMO services and biocatalysis projects.
    *   **Generics API:** Declined by 2% YoY to ₹2,545 crores. ARV API revenue was steady (+1%) and Oncology API saw strong demand (+27%), but the 'Other API' segment declined by 22% due to competitive pricing pressure and lower demand.
*   **Geographical Performance:**
    *   Exports contributed 61% of total revenue.
    *   Revenue share by region: Europe (27%), North America (17%), Rest of World (ROW) (56%). Developed markets (North America, Europe, Japan) contribution remained steady at 44%.

### Cost Structure Analysis

*   **Cost of Materials Consumed:** Gross margin was 51.7% in FY24, down from 54.1% in FY23 (a decrease of 240 bps), indicating a relative increase in material costs as a percentage of revenue, primarily attributed to product mix changes.
*   **Employee Benefits Expense:** Increased to ₹640 crores in FY24 from ₹581 crores in FY23. As a percentage of revenue, this represents an increase from 9.6% in FY23 to 12.7% in FY24, driven by an increase in employee headcount (+400).
*   **Other Expenses:** Increased to ₹1,191 crores in FY24 from ₹1,093 crores in FY23. As a percentage of revenue, this rose significantly to 23.6% in FY24 from 18.1% in FY23. This increase reflects higher R&D spending (4.8% of sales or ₹241 crores absolute) and upfront costs associated with growth projects and new initiatives (including Cell & Gene Therapy, Animal Health, LSPL Unit 2 expenses).

### Margin Analysis

*   **Gross Margin:** Declined by 240 basis points to 51.7% in FY24 from 54.1% in FY23, impacted by product mix.
*   **EBITDA Margin:** Contracted significantly by 1,060 basis points to 15.8% in FY24 from 26.4% in FY23. This was primarily due to the impact of the large PO completion in FY23, lower asset utilisation, increased R&D spending, and upfront costs for growth projects in FY24.
*   **Net Profit Margin:** Declined sharply by 990 basis points to 3.2% in FY24 from 13.1% in FY23, reflecting the decrease in EBITDA and higher effective tax rate (28.83% vs 28.16%).

### Operating Leverage

*   The company experienced negative operating leverage in FY24. Consolidated revenue declined by 17%, while EBITDA plummeted by 50% (from ₹1,594 crores to ₹798 crores).

    *   LSPL Unit 2 (new facility) expenses: ₹24 crores.
    *   Gross obligation expenses (related to Laurus Bio NCI Put Option): ₹6 crores.
*   Comparability with FY23 is significantly affected by the completion of a large, material PO supply (contributing ₹1,424 crores to CDMO revenue in FY23, nil in FY24).

### GAAP vs Non-GAAP Reconciliation

*   The report uses EBITDA as a key performance metric, which is a non-GAAP measure.

### EPS Analysis

*   **Basic EPS:** Decreased by 80% to ₹3.00 in FY24 from ₹14.70 in FY23.
*   **Diluted EPS:** Decreased by 80% to ₹2.99 in FY24 from ₹14.65 in FY23.

## Laurus Labs Limited: FY24 Financial Analysis

### Overall Financial Performance (Consolidated)

*   **Revenue:** Reported Revenue from Operations stood at ₹5,041 crores, a 17% decrease year-on-year (YoY) from ₹6,041 crores in FY23. This decline is primarily attributed to the completion of a large Purchase Order (PO) supply to a major pharma client in FY23 (worth ₹1,424 crores). Excluding this PO effect, core business revenue grew by 9%.
*   **Profitability:**
    *   Gross Margin remained relatively resilient at 51.7%, compared to 54.1% in FY23.
    *   EBITDA significantly decreased by 50% to ₹798 crores (vs. ₹1,594 crores in FY23). EBITDA margin contracted sharply to 15.8% from 26.4%, impacted by lower asset utilization, upfront costs associated with growth projects (including Cell & Gene Therapy, Animal Health), higher R&D spending, and the base effect of the large FY23 PO.
    *   Profit After Tax (PAT) declined by 80% to ₹161 crores (vs. ₹790 crores in FY23). PAT margin was 3.2% compared to 13.1% in FY23.
    *   Earnings Per Share (EPS) (Diluted) decreased to ₹3.0 from ₹14.6 in FY23.
*   **Dividend:** The company declared a total dividend of ₹0.80 per share (40% on face value ₹2), resulting in a payout ratio of 19% (total payout ₹86 crores).

### Segment-wise Performance Analysis (Consolidated)

*   **Generics - FDF (Formulation Finished Dosage):** Revenue grew strongly by 24% YoY to ₹1,414 crores. Growth was driven by stabilizing ARV business, volume expansion in developed markets, new US product launches, and increased CMO activity. The JV with KRKA is expected to enhance this segment's portfolio and market reach.
*   **Generics - API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients):** Revenue was ₹2,545 crores, a slight decline of 2% YoY.
    *   ARV API revenue remained steady (+1%).
    *   Oncology API saw strong demand, growing 27%.
    *   Non-ARV/Non-Oncology API revenues declined by 22% due to lower demand and competitive pricing pressures, despite strong CMO contract deliveries. Focus remains on leveraging large-scale capacity for dual sourcing opportunities.
*   **CDMO - Synthesis:** Revenue stood at ₹922 crores. While reported revenue declined due to the non-recurrence of the large FY23 PO, the core CDMO business grew by 24%. This was supported by increased RFPs from large pharma/biotech, growth in the commercial pipeline (70+ active projects, 10 commercial), and expansion into Animal Health DS. A multi-year MSA with a leading crop protection company provides future visibility.
*   **Biotechnology (Laurus Bio):** Revenue grew by 28% YoY to ₹160 crores, driven by CDMO services and leveraging biocatalysis expertise. Demand for CDMO services is strong, and capacity expansion (including a $40M investment in microbial fermentation) is underway. The company increased its stake in Laurus Bio to 87.58%.

### Financial Position and Liquidity (Consolidated)

*   **Assets:** Total assets increased to ₹8,155 crores from ₹7,820 crores. Net Fixed Assets (including CWIP) rose to ₹4,048 crores (+₹348 crores) due to significant investments, primarily in the CDMO business (new R&D centre, manufacturing blocks).

While Inventories increased to ₹1,845 crores (+₹160 crores) and Receivables grew to ₹1,663 crores (+₹83 crores), this was more than offset by a significant increase in Payables to ₹1,051 crores (+₹340 crores).
*   **Debt:** Total Debt (current and non-current) increased by ₹535 crores to ₹2,507 crores. This increase was primarily driven by long-term debt to fund key growth projects in CDMO and infrastructure. The Debt-Equity ratio increased to 0.61 from 0.49.
*   **Cash Flow:** Cash generated from operations was strong at ₹976 crores (vs. ₹1,050 crores in FY23). Net cash used in investing activities was significant at ₹817 crores (vs. ₹1,374 crores) mainly due to capex. Net cash from financing activities was ₹(34) crores (vs. ₹439 crores), reflecting higher debt proceeds offset by repayments
