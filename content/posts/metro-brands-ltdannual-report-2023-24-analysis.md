    *   Intense competition from unorganized retailers, established brands, and international players.
    *   Managing margin risk in the online business due to promotions and discounts.
    *   Adapting rapidly to the change in customer preference.

## Risk Framework

### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High, due to the potential impact on long-term growth and market positioning, particularly with new ventures like the Foot Locker partnership and repositioning of the FILA brand.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. The footwear market is competitive and consumer preferences are evolving rapidly.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. Premiumisation and casualisation trends and the fast growth in sports, athleisure and sneakers segment are intensifying competition and the need for successful brand positioning.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Diversified brand portfolio (in-house and third-party), strategic partnerships (Foot Locker, Crocs, FitFlop), expansion into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, and an omni-channel presence.
*    **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. Store network expansion and e-commerce growth demonstrate progress, but the success of new ventures (Foot Locker, FILA repositioning) is yet to be fully realized.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant. Success in strategic initiatives could drive substantial revenue growth (11% YoY revenue increase in FY23-24), while failure could lead to inventory write-offs (as seen with FILA's surplus inventory) and missed growth targets. The company states plans to open 225 new stores over the next two years.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Disruptions in supply chain or store operations can impact sales and profitability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Reliance on third-party manufacturers and the implementation of BIS Quality Control Order (QCO) introduce potential disruptions.
*   **Trend:** Increasing, temporarily. The BIS QCO implementation led to front-loaded inventory purchases, increasing inventory levels until full alignment is achieved by the end of 2024-25.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Front-loading inventory purchases to mitigate BIS QCO disruptions. Vendor collaboration and guidance on BIS compliance. Investment in technology (AI-based supply chain model, e-commerce-specific WMS, OMS) to enhance efficiency and minimize dead stock.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. Front-loading inventory mitigates immediate supply chain risks, but long-term effectiveness depends on vendor compliance with BIS standards. Technology investments are ongoing.
*    **Potential Financial Impact:** Moderate. Higher inventory levels ('698.19 Crores in FY23-24 vs. '624.64 Crores in FY22-23) increase carrying costs. Supply chain disruptions could impact sales and margins.

### Financial Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Market fluctuations, credit risk with trade receivables, and margin pressures from online discounting pose risks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. The retail sector is subject to economic cycles and competitive pressures.
*   **Trend:** Stable. The Company maintains strong financial metrics, but online discounting poses an ongoing challenge.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Asset-light business model, efficient operating model (negotiation power, variable compensation, AI-based supply chain), disciplined financial management, and strong cash flow generation (Operating cash flow of '590 crores in FY23-24).
*    **Control Effectiveness:** High. The Company has a proven financial track record, with 14% 5-year revenue CAGR and 16% 5-year EBITDA CAGR. EBITDA margins are 29.8%. Strong cash flow enables business expansion primarily through internal funds.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Moderate. Margin pressures in online business exist (e-commerce sales grew 33% YoY, contributing 9.5% to total revenue).

### Compliance/Regulatory Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Non-compliance with BIS regulations could disrupt the supply chain.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. The Company is actively working with vendors to ensure compliance.
*   **Trend:** Decreasing. The Company expects full alignment with BIS regulations by the end of 2024-25.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Collaboration with vendors, front-loading inventory, and providing guidance on BIS compliance.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. Ongoing efforts are aimed at achieving full compliance.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Moderate. Primarily linked to potential supply chain disruptions and inventory management challenges.

### Emerging Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium to High. Rapidly evolving consumer preferences and the growing sports and athleisure segment represent both opportunities and risks.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Consumer trends are dynamic and the competitive landscape is evolving.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. Premiumisation, casualisation, and the sports and athleisure segment are gaining momentum.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Partnerships with Foot Locker and FILA. R&D investments, omni-channel, and customer data and AI to drive product customization.
*    **Control Effectiveness:** To be determined. The strategies are in place, but their effectiveness depends on successful execution and market reception.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant. Success in capturing emerging trends could lead to substantial revenue growth, while failure could result in missed opportunities and lost market share.

*   **Foot Locker and FILA Performance:** The success of these partnerships is crucial. If the brands underperform or integration challenges arise, it could affect projected growth rates.
*   **E-commerce Profitability:** Success in reducing discounts and improving operational efficiencies in e-commerce is essential for sustaining the 33% growth rate and 9.5% revenue contribution.
*   **Recycling:** Recycling of 50% of sold shoes is the current level with a target to achieve 100%.
