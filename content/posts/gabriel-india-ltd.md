    * **Transparency and Accountability:**  Commitment to ethical business practices,  risk management, and robust internal controls.
    * **Whistleblower Policy:**  Mechanism in place for reporting unethical behavior.

**Overall Assessment:**

Gabriel India Limited's Annual Report 2023-24 reflects a year of strong financial performance, driven by robust growth across its various business segments.  The company demonstrates a proactive approach to managing risks and a commitment to sustainable growth, evidenced by its significant ESG initiatives.  The diversification into the sunroof market showcases a strategic outlook for future growth, though this segment remains in its early stages.  Continued focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and stakeholder engagement will be key to navigating the challenges and capitalizing on opportunities in the dynamic automotive industry.  The high level of reliance on certain major customers, however, remains a potential risk to be managed.

### Asset Analysis
The values for the requested financial metrics are presented separately for the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Here's a breakdown of the figures from the provided annual report (all amounts are in Indian Rupees in millions):


**Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Total Assets:** ₹16,120.25 million
* **Current Assets:** ₹10,543.19 million
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹566.59 million
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** ₹4,529.36 million
* **Inventory:** ₹2,357.30 million


**Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Total Assets:**  The exact figure for total assets in the consolidated balance sheet isn't clearly stated as a single number in the provided text; it's presented as a summation of many asset categories.
* **Current Assets:**  Similarly, the consolidated current assets are not presented as a single, easily extracted value.
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹599.28 million
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** ₹4,914.33 million
* **Inventory:** ₹2,915.16 million


**Important Note:**  The consolidated financial statements include the figures for subsidiaries, leading to higher values for assets and other line items compared to the standalone figures which only represent the parent company.  Also, minor discrepancies might exist between these extracted numbers and the exact reported numbers due to rounding or potential transcription errors in this digital copy of the report.  For precise figures, you should always refer directly to the official printed or digital version of the annual report from Gabriel India Limited's website.

### Liability Analysis
Here's a breakdown of the total liabilities, current liabilities, long-term debt, and accounts payable figures from Gabriel India Limited's Annual Report 2023-24, presented separately for the standalone and consolidated financial statements (all amounts are in Indian Rupees in millions):


**Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹6,033.75 million
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹5,678.07 million
* **Long-Term Debt:**  The report doesn't explicitly state a single "long-term debt" figure.  However,  long-term lease liabilities are reported as ₹86.84 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities as ₹133.24 million.  These are components of the total liabilities but not a singular "long-term debt" category.
* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** ₹4,891.75 million


**Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Total Liabilities:** The consolidated total liabilities are not presented as a directly extractable value; instead,  it's a calculation derived from the summation of various liability categories.
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹6,686.14 million
* **Long-Term Debt:** Similar to the standalone report,  a specific "long-term debt" line item isn't shown.  Components of long-term liabilities include long-term lease obligations (₹452.23 million) and long-term deferred tax liabilities (₹133.24 million).  These represent portions of the total liabilities.
* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** ₹5,877.38 million


**Important Note:** The consolidated figures include the liabilities of the subsidiaries, resulting in higher values than those reported standalone.  Again, slight variations from the officially reported numbers might occur due to rounding or transcription issues with the digital copy. Always consult the original published report from Gabriel India's official sources for precise figures.

### Equity Analysis
Here's a summary of the shareholders' equity, retained earnings, and share capital for Gabriel India Limited, extracted from the Annual Report 2023-24, again shown separately for standalone and consolidated figures (all amounts in Indian Rupees in millions):


**Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Shareholders' Equity (Total Equity):** ₹10,086.50 million
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹9,281.21 million (This is a component of Reserves and Surplus)
* **Share Capital (Equity Share Capital):** ₹143.64 million


**Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Shareholders' Equity (Total Equity):** ₹9,877.88 million
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹9,216.25 million (This is a component of Reserves and Surplus)
* **Share Capital (Equity Share Capital):** ₹143.64 million


**Important Considerations:**

* **Reserves and Surplus:**  The annual report shows retained earnings as part of a broader "Reserves and Surplus" category.  The retained earnings figures listed above represent the portion of Reserves and Surplus attributable to retained profits. Other components, such as securities premium and other reserves, are also included within the total equity figure.
* **Consolidated vs. Standalone:** The consolidated equity is lower than the standalone equity. This is because the consolidation process involves adjustments such as minority interests, which reduce the equity attributable to the parent company's shareholders.  Also,  the  consolidated  statements include the equity of subsidiary companies.
* **Accuracy:** Remember that these numbers are extracted from a text version of the report, and minor differences may exist compared to the officially published figures due to rounding or transcription errors. To ensure precision, always consult the original annual report.

**Important Notes:**

* **Rounding:** Minor discrepancies may exist between these numbers and those precisely reported in the official annual report, due to rounding.
* **Consolidated vs. Standalone:** The consolidated figures are higher than the standalone figures because they include the results of subsidiary companies.
* **Finance Costs:** Finance costs (interest expense) are *excluded* from the calculation of operating income (EBITDA) in both statements, as is customary.

Always refer to the original Gabriel India Limited Annual Report for precise figures.


### Bottom Line Metrics
Here's a summary of the net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS from Gabriel India Limited's Annual Report for FY2023-24, shown separately for standalone and consolidated results (all amounts are in Indian Rupees in millions, except EPS which is per share):


**Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Diluted EPS:** ₹12.44 per share (The report shows that basic and diluted EPS are the same)


**Important Note:**  Always refer to the original official report for the most accurate values.  There's a possibility of slight variations due to rounding differences when extracting data from a text version.  The consolidated figures reflect the performance of the parent company and its subsidiaries, while the standalone figures represent only the parent company's performance.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Here's a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows for Gabriel India Limited from its FY2023-24 Annual Report, shown separately for standalone and consolidated statements (all amounts are in Indian Rupees in millions):


**Standalone Statement of Cash Flows (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹1,888.94 million (Net cash inflow)
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(1,197.31) million (Net cash outflow)

* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(1,286.18) million (Net cash outflow)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹(278.71) million (Net cash outflow)


**Important Notes:**

* **Net Increase/Decrease in Cash:** The net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents is the sum of operating, investing, and financing cash flows.  In the standalone statement, it was ₹168.31 million; in the consolidated statement, it was ₹201.00 million.
* **Parent vs. Subsidiaries:** The consolidated cash flows include the cash flow activities of the subsidiaries, resulting in differences compared to the standalone figures.
* **Rounding and Potential Errors:** There's a small chance of minor discrepancies due to rounding or transcription errors when extracting data from a text representation of the report.  Refer to the original report for definitive values.

Remember to consult the official Gabriel India Limited Annual Report for precise numbers.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The provided annual report doesn't explicitly state "free cash flow" as a single line item.  Free cash flow is typically calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.  We can, however, determine the other two metrics: capital expenditure and dividends paid, from both standalone and consolidated statements (all amounts are in Indian Rupees in millions):


**Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  The report states that capital expenditure incurred during the year was ₹830 million.  This is derived from the investing cash flow section; It includes payments for property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets and investment properties.
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹452.48 million (This is stated explicitly in the report)


**Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  The consolidated capital expenditure is not a directly stated value in the provided report;  it must be calculated from the cash flow statement. The total cash outflow from investing activities was ₹1,286.18 million. However, this value includes other items besides CAPEX, so the exact CAPEX figure for the consolidated statements isn't readily available.
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹453.40 million (This value is mentioned directly)


**Free Cash Flow Calculation (Estimate):**

To  estimate  the  free  cash  flow, we need to subtract  capital  expenditure  from  operating  cash  flow.  However,  a precise  consolidated  CAPEX  figure  is  not available  in the text provided, preventing a precise calculation of consolidated free cash flow.

* **Standalone Free Cash Flow (Estimate):** ₹1,888.94 million (Operating Cash Flow) - ₹830 million (CAPEX) = ₹1,058.94 million
* **Consolidated Free Cash Flow (Estimate):** Cannot be precisely calculated due to the lack of a clearly stated consolidated CAPEX figure from the provided text.  You would need to perform this calculation yourself using the complete, official annual report.

**Important Note:**  These figures, especially the free cash flow estimates, rely on information extracted from the provided text. The consolidated CAPEX requires a more detailed examination of the consolidated cash flow statement which is only partially visible in the extract. Always refer to the official Gabriel India Limited Annual Report for completely accurate and precise data.

### Profitability Ratios
We can calculate profitability ratios for Gabriel India Limited using the data provided in the annual report.  Remember that these calculations are based on the figures extracted, so minor variations are possible when compared to the company's official calculations due to rounding or other factors. All values are expressed as percentages.


**Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹8,720.18 million / ₹33,426.48 million) * 100 = 26.07%
* **Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100.  Operating income (EBIT) is not directly stated, so this cannot be calculated precisely.  The closest approximation would be to use EBITDA (₹2,929.70 million), but this would be an approximation as it excludes interest and taxes. Using EBITDA as a proxy, the approximate operating margin would be (₹2,929.70 million / ₹33,426.48 million) * 100 = 8.76%
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹1,851.60 million / ₹33,426.48 million) * 100 = 5.53%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** The report states the ROE as 19.7%.
* **Return on Assets (ROA):**  Requires net income and average total assets.   The average total assets is not directly provided so this cannot be calculated.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹8,714.62 million / ₹34,026.26 million) * 100 = 25.61%
* **Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):**  Similar to the standalone case, EBIT is not explicitly provided. Using the EBITDA (₹2,949.50 million) as an approximation: (₹2,949.50 million / ₹34,026.26 million) * 100 = 8.67%
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹1,787.47 million / ₹34,026.26 million) * 100 = 5.25%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** The report does not provide a consolidated ROE figure.
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** Cannot be calculated directly from the provided data as average total assets are not given.


**Important Considerations:**

* **EBIT vs. EBITDA:**  The calculation of the operating margin is approximate in both cases because the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) is not directly provided, and EBITDA, which includes depreciation and amortization, is used as a substitute. Using EBIT would produce a more precise operating margin.
* **ROA Calculation:** Return on assets (ROA) requires average total assets, which is not readily available in the provided textual data.
* **Rounding:** Minor variations might occur due to rounding when compared to the official report.

To obtain precise figures for all these ratios, please refer directly to the complete and official annual report.  The report likely contains these ratios explicitly calculated by the company.

### Liquidity Ratios
The provided text of Gabriel India Limited's annual report gives the current ratio but doesn't provide enough information to directly calculate the quick ratio or the cash ratio.  Here's what we can determine:


**Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Current Ratio:** The report states this ratio as 1.86.  This is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.

* **Quick Ratio:** This ratio is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.  While we have the standalone values for current assets and current liabilities, the inventory value is included within current assets and cannot be easily separated from the provided text. Therefore, the quick ratio cannot be precisely calculated.

* **Cash Ratio:** This is calculated as (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities. Again, the necessary standalone values for cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities are available, but a precise calculation is not possible without a clearer breakdown of the current assets which includes cash.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Current Ratio:**  This ratio is not explicitly stated in the consolidated financial statement section of the provided text.  It would require calculating Current Assets / Current Liabilities using the provided data.

* **Quick Ratio:** Cannot be directly calculated from the provided data for similar reasons as in the standalone statement. A precise breakdown of the components of current assets is needed.

* **Cash Ratio:** Cannot be directly calculated. A detailed breakdown of the current assets that clearly isolates the cash and cash equivalents is required for a precise calculation.



**In summary:**  Only the standalone current ratio is directly provided in the report extract. To calculate the quick ratio and cash ratio, and the consolidated current ratio, you would need to obtain the full, official annual report to access the complete balance sheet and ensure accurate component separation within the current assets.



### Efficiency Ratios
The provided annual report gives some turnover ratios but not all of them.  Let's break down what's available and what's missing for both the standalone and consolidated financial statements.  Note that these calculations are based on extracted data, and slight discrepancies might occur due to rounding when comparing to the official report.  All values are in times (or days where specified).


**Standalone Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Asset Turnover:** This ratio is calculated as Revenue / Average Total Assets.  The revenue is provided (₹33,426.48 million), but the average total assets require the beginning and ending total assets which is not directly provided in the text. Therefore, a precise calculation is not possible.  The report does state the return on investment (ROI) which is related but not equivalent.

* **Inventory Turnover:** The report states this ratio as 26 days. This represents the number of days the inventory remains on hand.

* **Receivables Turnover:** The report provides this ratio as 52 days. This represents the number of days it takes to collect accounts receivables.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (for the year ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Asset Turnover:**  Cannot be precisely calculated from the provided data. The information needed to calculate average total assets is missing.

* **Inventory Turnover:** The report doesn't explicitly state this ratio for the consolidated statements.

* **Receivables Turnover:**  The report doesn't explicitly state this ratio for the consolidated statements.


**In summary:**  The provided text gives limited efficiency ratios.  To calculate all three turnover ratios (asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover), and to obtain the complete consolidated figures, you need the full and official annual report from Gabriel India Limited with the complete balance sheets and income statements.  The report itself will likely present these ratios already calculated.


### Leverage Ratios
The annual report provides some use ratios but not all of them.  Let's examine what's available, keeping in mind that these calculations are based on extracted data, and there might be minor variations from the official report's figures due to rounding or other factors.


**Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** The report states this ratio as 0.01. This is calculated as Total Debt / Total Equity.  Note that the report doesn't explicitly define "Total Debt" as a single line item.  The components of debt considered likely include lease liabilities and any other long-term financial liabilities.

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:**  This ratio is calculated as Total Debt / Total Assets.  We cannot calculate this precisely due to the absence of a clearly stated "Total Debt" figure in the provided text extract.

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** The report states this ratio as 53.89. This is calculated as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  EBIT is not directly given;  the report uses EBITDA as a proxy in some calculations, leading to an approximation.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**  The report does not provide this ratio explicitly for the consolidated statements.  It would require calculating Total Debt / Total Equity using the appropriate data from the consolidated balance sheet.  The definition of "Total Debt" here would similarly include lease liabilities and other relevant long-term liabilities.

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Cannot be directly calculated. We lack a clearly stated "Total Debt" figure and also need the exact consolidated total assets from the report itself.

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** This ratio is not explicitly provided. To calculate it precisely you'd need the consolidated EBIT and total interest expense.


**In summary:** Only the standalone debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio are directly available in the provided text extract. The consolidated and other ratios require additional information that's not easily extractable from the partial data provided.  Refer to the official annual report for the complete and accurate figures.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided annual report gives some market valuation data but lacks the information needed to calculate all the requested ratios precisely. Let's analyze what's available and what's missing:


**Market Capitalization:**

* The report gives the market capitalization as ₹4,790.53 crore (BSE) and ₹4,795.55 crore (NSE) as of March 31, 2024.  (Note: 1 crore = 10 million).


**Other Ratios (Calculations and Missing Data):**

To calculate the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, Price-to-Book (PB) ratio, dividend yield, and dividend payout ratio, we need additional information not readily available in the text extract of the annual report:

* **PE Ratio:** This is calculated as Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS).  The report provides the EPS but not the market price per share as of a specific date for calculating the PE ratio.

* **PB Ratio:** This is calculated as Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share. We have the book value per share from the standalone financial statement section (₹70.22). However, the market price per share is needed, which is not directly provided.

* **Dividend Yield:** This is calculated as Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share. Again, the annual dividend per share is available,  but we're missing the market price per share.

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** This is calculated as Total Dividends Paid / Net Income. We have the total dividends paid (₹452.48 million from standalone statements and ₹453.40 million from consolidated) and net income (₹1,851.60 million standalone and ₹1,787.47 million consolidated), allowing for calculation:

    * **Standalone Dividend Payout Ratio:** (₹452.48 million / ₹1,851.60 million) * 100 = 24.44%
    * **Consolidated Dividend Payout Ratio:** (₹453.40 million / ₹1,787.47 million) * 100 = 25.37%

**In summary:**

Only the market capitalization is directly available from the provided text. To compute the PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield, you will need to obtain the market price per share from a reliable financial data source (like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg) as of the relevant date (ideally March 31, 2024, or a date close to it).  The dividend payout ratio is calculated above using the provided data.  Always cross-reference your calculations with the company's official report for accuracy.




## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
Gabriel India Limited operates in many business segments.  Precise growth rates and operating margins aren't explicitly detailed for every segment in the provided annual report text. However, we can compile the available information:
