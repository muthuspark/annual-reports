## Cash Management Analysis of Transformers and Rectifiers (India) Limited (TRIL) - FY24

Based on data provided up to April 20, 2024 (primarily FY24 Annual Report context)

### Cash Flow Analysis (Standalone FY24 vs FY23)

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** TRIL generated a Net OCF of ₹2,325.36 Lakhs in FY24, a decrease from ₹2,985.14 Lakhs in FY23.
    *   Profit Before Tax was higher at ₹5,641.79 Lakhs (vs. ₹4,988.84 Lakhs in FY23).
    *   Key adjustments include Depreciation (₹2,083.41 Lakhs) and Finance Costs (₹4,569.28 Lakhs).
    *   Significant working capital changes impacted OCF negatively compared to FY23. Notably, Trade Payables decreased substantially (-₹10,632.42 Lakhs vs. +₹2,581.10 Lakhs increase in FY23), partially offset by a decrease in Trade Receivables (+₹2,488.96 Lakhs vs. -₹13,683.04 Lakhs increase in FY23) and a smaller increase in Inventories (-₹410.10 Lakhs vs. -₹2,131.80 Lakhs increase in FY23).
    *   Cash Generated from Operations before tax was ₹4,526.70 Lakhs (vs. ₹2,410.29 Lakhs in FY23), but after tax payments (₹2,201.34 Lakhs), the Net OCF decreased year-over-year.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash used in investing activities was -₹2,563.81 Lakhs in FY24, compared to -₹1,371.04 Lakhs in FY23.
    *   The primary outflow was the Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) and Intangibles amounting to ₹1,323.53 Lakhs (vs. ₹1,587.04 Lakhs in FY23).
    *   Net outflow from Mutual Fund Investments was ₹1,381.22 Lakhs in FY24 (vs. inflow of ₹349.42 Lakhs in FY23).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Net cash generated from financing activities was ₹4,708.39 Lakhs in FY24, a significant shift from the net cash used of -₹4,732.19 Lakhs in FY23.
    *   The major inflow was ₹11,981.25 Lakhs from the Preferential Equity Share issue (net of expenses, based on ₹120 Cr raised less ~₹19 Lakhs expenses).
    *   Net repayment of borrowings was significant: Long-term borrowing repayments were ₹1,077.13 Lakhs (vs. ₹4,495.66 Lakhs in FY23), and net repayment of Working Capital Borrowings was ₹6,081.79 Lakhs (vs. proceeds of ₹5,088.01 Lakhs in FY23).
    *   Finance costs paid were ₹4,569.28 Lakhs (vs. ₹4,613.84 Lakhs in FY23).
    *   Dividend paid increased to ₹198.82 Lakhs (vs. ₹172.33 Lakhs in FY23).
*   **Overall:** The company funded its operations and investments primarily through equity issuance in FY24, allowing for significant debt reduction. OCF decreased due to adverse working capital movements, particularly the reduction in trade payables.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency (Standalone)

*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Decreased from 4.48 in FY23 to 3.89 in FY24, indicating slower inventory movement. (MD&A data). This aligns with the increase in closing inventory value (₹24,693.11 Lakhs vs ₹24,283.01 Lakhs) despite slightly lower COGS.
*   **Debtors' Turnover Ratio:** Decreased from 2.43 in FY23 to 2.07 in FY24, suggesting slower collection of receivables. (MD&A data). Trade receivables decreased slightly (₹59,767.56 Lakhs vs ₹63,489.60 Lakhs), but the decrease in revenue was proportionally larger.
*   **Trade Payables Turnover Ratio:** Increased from 3.57 in FY23 to 3.70 in FY24, indicating faster payment to suppliers relative to purchases/COGS. (MD&A data). Trade payables reduced significantly (₹23,133.45 Lakhs vs ₹33,881.21 Lakhs).
*   **Net Capital Turnover Ratio (Working Capital Turnover):** Decreased from 5.05 in FY23 to 3.64 in FY24, indicating less efficient use of working capital to generate sales, primarily driven by the lower revenue and shifts within working capital components. (MD&A data implies calculation used Revenue / Avg Working Capital).
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) - Calculated Estimate:**
    *   *COGS (FY24)* = 91,034.08 + 2,123.18 - 410.10 = ₹92,747.16 Lakhs
    *   *Avg Inventory (FY24)* = (24,283.01 + 24,693.11) / 2 = ₹24,488.06 Lakhs
    *   *Avg Receivables (FY24)* = (63,489.60 + 59,767.56) / 2 = ₹61,628.58 Lakhs
    *   *Avg Payables (FY24)* = (33,881.21 + 23,133.45) / 2 = ₹28,507.33 Lakhs
    *   *DIO (FY24)* = (24488.06 / 92747.16) * 366 = 96.5 days
    *   *DSO (FY24)* = (61628.58 / 127331) * 366 = 177.1 days
    *   *DPO (FY24)* = (28507.33 / 92747.16) * 366 = 112.5 days
    *   *CCC (FY24)* = 96.5 + 177.1 - 112.5 = **161.1 days**
    *   *Similar Calculation for FY23 yields CCC approx 176 days.*
    *   The CCC shows a slight improvement (reduction) in FY24, driven mainly by faster payments to suppliers (lower DPO) offsetting slower collections (higher DSO) and slightly slower inventory movement (higher DIO). However, overall working capital efficiency ratios (turnover) declined.

### Capex Analysis

*   Total Capex (Purchase of PPE, Intangibles, CWIP additions) in FY24 was ₹1,323.53 Lakhs (Standalone ICF), lower than FY23's ₹1,587.04 Lakhs. Consolidated Capex was ₹1,426.33 Lakhs in FY24 vs ₹1,959.83 Lakhs in FY23.
*   The company primarily operates in the single segment of manufacturing transformers and rectifiers.
*   A key strategic initiative mentioned involves capacity expansion specifically for transformers catering to the **renewables sector**, targeted for completion by December 2024 (as per Chairman's & CFO's letters). This indicates future capex will be directed towards this high-growth area.
*   The CWIP balance increased to ₹1,520.06 Lakhs from ₹532.46 Lakhs (Standalone), suggesting ongoing investment projects.

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividend:** The Board recommended a final dividend of ₹0.20 per share (20% on face value ₹1) for FY24, subject to shareholder approval. This is an increase from the ₹0.15 per share (15%) paid for FY23. This signals confidence in performance and a move towards rewarding shareholders despite slightly lower revenue in FY24.
*   **Share Buyback:** No share buyback activities were mentioned or undertaken during the period under review. The Secretarial Audit Report confirms non-applicability of buyback regulations.

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) (Standalone)

*   The DSCR saw a significant decline from 2.50 in FY23 to 1.20 in FY24 (MD&A data).
*   While Profit Before Tax and Finance Costs (approximating EBITDA used for coverage) increased slightly (₹12,858 Lakhs in FY24 vs ₹11,795 Lakhs in FY23), the debt service burden (Interest + Principal Repayments) likely increased relative to earnings available for servicing, or the calculation methodology differed significantly between the years presented in the MD&A. The Cash Flow Statement shows lower finance costs paid (₹4,569 Lakhs vs ₹4,614 Lakhs) and lower LT debt repayments (₹1,077 Lakhs vs ₹4,496 Lakhs). The provided DSCR figure seems inconsistent with cash flow movements and requires further investigation or clarification on its calculation method. A DSCR of 1.20 indicates lower cushion for debt servicing compared to 2.50.

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

*   **Current Ratio:** Improved slightly from 1.10 in FY23 to 1.40 in FY24 (MD&
