#### Analytical Points:

*   Operating Cash Flow turned significantly negative in FY24, primarily driven by a substantial increase in working capital, particularly inventories (Increase of ₹1,787.21 crore in standalone inventories).
*   Investing Cash Flow turned positive in FY24, largely due to net proceeds from the sale of current investments. Capital expenditure on PPE and intangibles reduced compared to FY23.
*   Financing Cash Flow saw a larger net outflow in FY24 due to higher net repayment of non-current borrowings.
*   Consequently, Free Cash Flow was substantially negative in FY24, a sharp contrast to the positive FCF in FY23, indicating cash burn after meeting operational and capital expenditure needs.

## Key Performance Indicators

## Segment Performance Analysis

## Risk Framework

### Comprehensive Risk Assessment

## Vardhman Textiles Limited - Financial and Operational Analysis (FY2023-24)

### Financial Performance Summary (FY2023-24)

Vardhman Textiles Limited reported a decline in standalone revenue from operations to ₹9,298.68 crore in FY2023-24, down from ₹9,840.79 crore in the previous fiscal. Consolidated revenue from operations also saw a decrease to ₹9,595.68 crore from ₹10,267.47 crore.

#### Profitability:

*   Standalone Profit Before Depreciation, Interest, and Tax (PBDIT) stood at ₹1,291.93 crore, compared to ₹1,477.85 crore in FY2022-23.
*   Standalone Net Profit after comprehensive income was ₹611.44 crore, a decrease from ₹751.83 crore in the prior year.
*   Consolidated PBDIT was ₹1,341.80 crore (FY23: ₹1,556.49 crore), and consolidated Net Profit after comprehensive income was ₹640.59 crore (FY23: ₹807.63 crore).
*   EBITDA margin (as per corporate overview graphics) was 13.41%, and Profit After Tax (PAT) margin was 6.31%.

#### Exports:

The company's FOB export value decreased by 8.52% to ₹3,899.00 crore from ₹4,242.52 crore in the previous year. Exports constituted approximately 41.93% of standalone revenue from operations.

#### Key Ratios (Standalone, as per MD&A for FY24 vs FY23):

*   Debtor Turnover Ratio (Days): 42 (FY23: 39)
*   Inventory Turnover (Days): 121 (FY23: 76) - Increase attributed to higher raw material inventory.
*   Interest Coverage Ratio (Times): 8.73 (FY23: 10.51)
*   Current Ratio (Times): 2.84 (FY23: 3.19)
*   Debt-Equity Ratio (Times): 0.20 (FY23: 0.22)
*   EBITDA Margin (%): 13.89% (FY23: 15.02%) - Based on MD&A calculation method.
*   Net Profit Margin (%): 6.53% (FY23: 7.61%) - Based on MD&A calculation method.
*   Return on Net Worth (%): 7.11% (FY23: 9.46%)

### Segmental Performance & Operational Highlights

#### Yarn:

*   Production increased to 2,62,291 MT from 2,33,314 MT.
*   The segment experienced volatility in cotton and yarn prices. Lower international cotton prices and slower demand put pressure on cotton yarn prices globally.
*   Increased differential between international and domestic cotton prices, coupled with an 11% import duty on cotton in India, squeezed margins. Minimum Support Price (MSP) for domestic cotton poses a competitiveness challenge if international prices drop significantly.
*   Spinning capacity utilization in India was approximately 70%.
*   Revenue from yarn (excluding internal transfers) was ₹5,868 crore in FY24.

#### Fabric:

*   Production of grey fabric increased to 204 million meters (from 182 million meters).
*   Production of processed fabric increased to 154 million meters (from 143 million meters).
*   The fabric business performed better, in line with expectations, with 85-90% capacity utilization.
*   Revenue from fabric in FY24 was ₹3,123 crore.

#### Garments:

*   Garment production reduced to 15,47,982 pieces from 18,00,955 pieces.
*   Revenue from garments was ₹112 crore in FY24.

### Strategic Initiatives & Investments

#### Yarn Business Modernization:

Planned investment of ₹1,000 crore+ for technology upgradation, balancing equipment for optimization, and limited expansion.

#### Fabric Division Expansion (Technical Textiles):

*   Venturing into technical textiles with an initial investment of approximately ₹300 crore.
*   Focus on manufacturing fabrics (approx. 15 lac meters/month) for sportswear, activewear, and other industrial/defence applications, recognizing the global shift towards non-cotton materials.

#### Sustainability and Green Energy:

*   Current green power constitutes ~2.5% of total energy consumption.
*   Aim to increase green energy share to 35-40% within the next couple of years through investments in solar and wind energy projects.
*   Focus on reducing water usage, minimizing waste, and promoting sustainable supply chain practices. Installed renewable energy capacity stands at 19.9 MW.

#### Capital Expenditure:

CAPEX in the past 5 years exceeded ₹2,428 crore. R&D expenditure over the past 5 years was over ₹44 crore.

### Market Environment & Outlook (Chairman's Perspective)

#### Global Economy:

FY2023-24 was challenging due to geopolitical conditions, impacting the export-oriented textile industry.

#### Indian Economy:

Remained resilient with real GDP growth above 8% in FY2023-24. Projections for FY2024-25 are 6.5-7% GDP growth, supported by the manufacturing sector benefiting from the 'China plus One' strategy and expected private sector capex.

#### Textile Industry:

*   Indian textile industry estimated at ~$165 billion, projected to grow to ~$350 billion by 2030, with textile and clothing (T&C) exports targeted at ~$100 billion.
*   Challenges from prevailing geopolitical conditions may act as headwinds.
*   Concern regarding domestic cotton prices (based on MSP) becoming uncompetitive if international prices fall drastically, especially with the 11% import duty.

#### Company Outlook:

While immediate future business environment (exports and domestic) has concerns due to geopolitical reasons, the company is hopeful for the bright future of the Indian textile industry. Focus remains on operational excellence, technological upgradation, scaling up, and customer value creation.

### Key Risks and Concerns

*   Geopolitical Instability: Affecting global market conditions and export demand.
*   Cotton Price Volatility: Fluctuations in domestic and international cotton prices impacting margins.
*   Domestic Cotton Competitiveness: Risk of Indian cotton (due to MSP and import duties) becoming uncompetitive if international prices remain significantly lower.
*   Slower Domestic Demand: The MD&A notes that the domestic market, which meets roughly three-fourths of total demand for Indian textiles, is still not vibrant.
*   Supply Chain Disruptions: Potential impact from events like disturbances in the Red Sea.
