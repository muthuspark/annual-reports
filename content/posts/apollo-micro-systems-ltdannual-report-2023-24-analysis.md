## Financial Analysis Report: Apollo Micro Systems Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   **Standalone Financial Statements:** The Independent Auditor's Report on Standalone Financial Statements, issued by S.T. Mohite & Co., Chartered Accountants, opines that the statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013. No qualifications were made to the opinion.

#### Key Audit Matters (KAMs) - Standalone

1.  **Capital Work in Progress (CWIP):** Appropriateness of recording costs (₹2,397.75 lakhs for testing tools/instruments and ₹3,075.59 lakhs for civil works) as CWIP, particularly the management's judgment in assessing if costs meet Ind AS 16 recognition criteria. Auditors assessed processes, tested controls, reviewed business plans, performed substantive tests on additions, and scrutinized ledgers. No inappropriate capitalization was identified.
2.  **Inventories:** Significant inventory holding (₹43,351 lakhs, 45.40% of total assets) with specific customer focus, posing remote obsolescence risk and difficulty in NRV estimation. Auditors assessed internal controls, reviewed physical verification procedures, tested management's physical counts, analyzed order book alignment with WIP/finished goods, and evaluated disclosure appropriateness.

*   **Consolidated Financial Statements:** The Independent Auditor's Report on Consolidated Financial Statements, also by S.T. Mohite & Co., opines that the statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs. No qualifications were made to the opinion.

#### Key Audit Matters (KAMs) - Consolidated

1.  **Capital Work in Progress (CWIP):** Similar to standalone, focusing on the appropriateness of CWIP recording (₹2,397.75 lakhs for testing tools/instruments and ₹1,182.70 lakhs for civil works under projects in progress). Auditor response mirrored the standalone approach.
2.  **Inventories:** Similar to standalone, concerning significant inventory holding (₹43,333.27 lakhs). Auditor response mirrored the standalone approach.

*   **Note on Internal Financial Controls (Standalone & Consolidated Auditor's Report):** While the overall opinion on internal financial controls was that they were adequate and operating effectively, a specific observation was made in the "Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" section [Para 2(i)(vi) for Standalone, Para 1(i)(vii) for Consolidated]. The accounting software used by the holding company (and its subsidiaries) did not have the audit trail (edit log) feature enabled throughout the financial year under review. Consequently, reporting on tampering or preservation of the audit trail was not applicable.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   The financial statements (standalone and consolidated) are prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual basis, complying with Ind AS, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value.
*   **Consistency:** The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of previous years. Note 3.17 (Recent Pronouncements) in the Standalone Financial Statements confirms that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has not notified any new standard or amendments applicable to the company for FY 2023-24 that would necessitate a change in accounting policy.

#### Key Policies Summarized

*   **Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):** Recognized when performance obligations are satisfied, and control transfers to the customer. Measured at transaction price net of discounts, returns, and GST.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized. ROU assets are amortized over the shorter of lease term or useful life.
*   **Property, Plant and Equipment (Ind AS 16):** Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over useful lives prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act or as per technical assessment.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value (NRV).
*   **Financial Instruments (Ind AS 109):** Initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent measurement based on classification (amortized cost or FVTOCI/FVTPL). Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model applied for impairment, with a simplified approach for trade receivables.
*   **Taxation:** Current tax based on taxable income. Deferred tax recognized using the balance sheet approach for temporary differences.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Short-term benefits expensed. Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund) expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (Gratuity) valued actuarially using the Projected Unit Credit method, with remeasurements through OCI.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   **Management's Responsibility:** Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls.
*   **Auditor's Opinion (Standalone & Consolidated - Annexure B):** The auditors opined that the company (and the Group) has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial control system over financial reporting and such controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024.
*   **Significant Deficiency Noted:** As highlighted under Auditor's Opinion [Section 1, point regarding Internal Financial Controls], both Standalone and Consolidated Auditor's Reports [Para 2(i)(vi) and 1(i)(vii) respectively] pointed out that the accounting software used did not have the audit trail (edit log) feature enabled throughout FY 2023-24. This is a significant deficiency in IT general controls, impacting the ability to ensure data integrity and track modifications to accounting records, even though the overall opinion on IFC effectiveness was positive.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **Secretarial Audit Report (Annexure-B to Directors' Report):**
    *   Observation 1: ROC, Hyderabad issued a show-cause notice (04/06/2024) for non-filing of Cost Audit Report (Form CRA-4) for FY 2022-23. The company responded (12/07/2024), citing oversight, and filed the form on 12/07/2024. No further ROC action reported as of the audit report date.
    *   Observation 2: BSE Limited levied a fine of ₹20,000 (plus taxes) for a one-day delay in filing the trading application for 2,29,99,990 equity shares allotted upon warrant conversion (SEBI ICDR Regs. & circular). Fine paid on 19/07/2023.
*   **Corporate Governance Report (Other Disclosures - Non-Compliance):**
    *   BSE fine for 1-day delay in trading application (as above).
    *   NSE fine of ₹47,200 for 8-day late submission of RPT disclosure for quarter ended March 2023.
    *   BSE & NSE fines of ₹1,35,700 each for improper Board Composition (period 13/10/2022 to 04/11/2022).
*   **Internal Financial Controls:** The lack of an enabled audit trail in the accounting software throughout the year (Auditor's Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements) is a deviation from expected IT governance standards, although not explicitly cited as a regulatory penalty in this section, it's a compliance concern.
