## Cash Management Analysis

### Cash Flow and Liquidity Analysis

#### Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

*   Net cash generated from operating activities decreased to ₹6,447.91 in FY24 from ₹7,950.23 in FY23.
*   Key Components (FY24): Net profit before tax (₹6,296.75) adjusted primarily for depreciation & amortization (₹2,602.24), finance costs (₹1,033.85), and employee stock compensation (₹31.34). Changes in working capital contributed a net inflow (₹2,404.02 reported as decrease in WC), contrasting with a smaller net inflow from WC changes in FY23 (₹764.96). Income taxes paid were higher at ₹717.75 vs ₹655.92 in FY23.
*   Analysis: Despite higher PBT in absolute terms, the OCF decreased primarily due to less favourable working capital movements compared to FY23. The core operations continue to generate healthy cash flow.

#### Investing Cash Flow (ICF)

*   Net cash used in investing activities was ₹579.93 in FY24, compared to net cash generated of ₹163.53 in FY23.
*   Key Components (FY24): Primarily driven by capital expenditure on property, plant & equipment (₹850.43) and net purchase of investments (₹324.34). In FY23, net proceeds from investments (₹637.42) offset lower capex (₹536.22).
*   Analysis: Higher capex in FY24 and a shift from net selling to net buying of current investments led to a net cash outflow from investing activities, indicating increased investment in fixed assets and financial instruments.

#### Financing Cash Flow (FCF)

*   Net cash used in financing activities decreased slightly to ₹5,641.87 in FY24 from ₹7,433.83 in FY23.
*   Key Components (FY24): Primarily comprised repayment of long-term borrowings (₹1,609.77), repayment of short-term borrowings (₹1,277.99), interest payments (₹1,010.70), dividend payments (₹2,405.94), lease liability repayments (₹1,410.14), and purchase of non-controlling interest (₹583.32). FY23 saw higher net repayment of short-term borrowings and higher lease liability repayments. Purchase of treasury shares was lower in FY24 (₹58.85 vs ₹139.58).
*   Analysis: Financing activities consistently show cash outflow due to debt servicing, lease payments, and shareholder returns (dividends, treasury share purchases). The reduction in outflow in FY24 was mainly due to lower net repayment of short-term debt and lower treasury share purchases.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   Debtors' days increased to 50 days in FY24 from 41 days in FY23, indicating slower collections.
*   Trade receivables increased by 11.8% YoY to ₹11,608.18 million, growing faster than the reported constant currency revenue growth (1.1%).
*   Trade payables increased by 32.0% YoY to ₹3,055.81 million. The significant increase suggests potentially extended payment terms or higher procurement activity towards year-end.
*   Overall Change in Working Capital: Net changes resulted in a cash inflow of ₹2,404.02 million in FY24, compared to an inflow of ₹764.96 million in FY23.

### Capex Analysis by Segment

*   Total capital expenditure increased significantly to ₹850.43 million in FY24 from ₹536.22 million in FY23.
*   Capex was mainly towards refurbishment and maintenance of operation centers, technology upgrades, and setting up new operations centers.

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

#### Dividends

*   The Company declared and paid an interim dividend of ₹3.50 per share for FY24, same as FY23.
*   Total dividend payout amounted to ₹2,405.94 million in FY24, compared to ₹2,384.45 million in FY23.
*   The dividend payout ratio remained consistent at approximately 47.7% in FY24 compared to 47.8% in FY23.

#### Share Buybacks (Treasury Shares)

*   The Company purchased treasury shares amounting to ₹58.85 million in FY24, significantly lower than the ₹139.58 million purchased in FY23.
*   As of March 31, 2024, the ESOP Trust held 9,376,900 equity shares (1.35% of total shares), down from 15,589,182 shares (2.24%) as of March 31, 2023.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   The Interest Coverage Ratio was 6.73 times in FY24, a slight decrease from 7.13 times in FY23.
*   While Operating EBIT increased significantly (23.6% YoY), finance costs also rose (31% YoY), leading to the slight moderation in the coverage ratio.
*   The ratio remains comfortably above typical covenant levels.

### Liquidity Position

*   Cash and cash equivalents stood at ₹1,747.74 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to ₹1,515.40 million as of March 31, 2023.
*   The Current Ratio was approximately 0.93 as of March 31, 2024, compared to approximately 0.92 as of March 31, 2023.
*   The increase in Debtors' Days to 50 suggests cash conversion is slowing slightly from receivables. However, the company generated positive OCF and maintained adequate cash balances.

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   **Consolidated Financial Statements:** The Independent Auditor, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, issued an unmodified opinion, stating that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS and the Companies Act, 2013. No qualifications were mentioned in the main opinion. Key Audit Matters highlighted were: Revenue recognition and measurement for un-invoiced amounts, Impairment assessment of goodwill, and Assessment of recoverability of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credit for SEZ units. The report notes reliance on unaudited financial information for an associate, deemed immaterial.
*   **Standalone Financial Statements:** The Independent Auditor issued an unmodified opinion, stating that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS and the Companies Act, 2013. No qualifications were mentioned. Key Audit Matters highlighted were: Revenue recognition and measurement for un-invoiced amounts, and Assessment of recoverability of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credit for SEZ units.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   **Basis of Preparation:** Financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual basis, complying with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI guidelines.
*   **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue is recognized based on the pattern of benefits from performance obligations transferred to the customer. Unit price contracts are measured by units delivered multiplied by agreed price; time and material contracts by effort expended multiplied by agreed price. Variable considerations (discounts, rebates, incentives) are estimated and reassessed each reporting period.
*   **Goodwill:** Goodwill represents the excess cost of acquisition over the net fair value of identifiable assets/liabilities. It is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses and tested for impairment annually or when indicators exist.
*   **Impairment:** Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model used for financial assets. Lifetime ECL is used for trade receivables. Goodwill impairment is tested at the CGU level based on value-in-use or fair value less cost to sell, involving significant estimates (growth rates, discount rates, margins). Other non-financial assets are evaluated when impairment indicators arise.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized, measured at the present value of lease payments. Significant judgment is applied in determining the lease term, including extension/termination options.
*   **Income Taxes:** Current and deferred taxes are recognized. Deferred tax assets (including MAT credit) are recognized when it is probable that future taxable profit will be available. Significant judgment is involved in determining provisions and recoverability, especially concerning SEZ benefits.
*   **Changes/Recent Pronouncements:** No new standards or amendments notified by MCA were applicable for FY 2023-24. The impact of the amendment to Ind AS 37 (Onerous Contracts) effective from April 1, 2022, was accounted for in the previous period's opening retained earnings.

*   **Director Disqualification:** Auditors confirmed, based on representations, that no director is disqualified under Section 164(2) of the Companies Act. A separate certificate confirmed no director was debarred by SEBI, MCA, or other authorities as of March 31, 2024.

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

*   **Tax Matters:** Pending litigations primarily relate to Income Tax and Service Tax demands.
    *   Income Tax demands (Consolidated & Standalone) amount to ₹1,917.41 million across various assessment years. The Company has disputed these, citing favorable decisions or grounds, and considers the provision for taxation adequate. Payments under protest have been made for specific assessment years (totaling ~₹110.38 million).
    *   Service Tax demands (Consolidated & Standalone) amount to ₹192.52 million, related to input credit and FCCB expenses, which are disputed in appeal. The Company expects favorable outcomes.
*   **Overall Assessment:** Management has reviewed pending litigations, made provisions where required, and disclosed contingent liabilities. They do not expect the outcomes to have a materially adverse effect on the financial statements. The Auditors' reports acknowledge the disclosure of pending litigations' impact.

### Related Party Transactions

*   All contracts/arrangements/transactions entered into with related parties during FY 2023-24 were reported to be on an arm's length basis and in the ordinary course of business.
*   No materially significant related party transactions requiring Board or Shareholder approval under the Act or LODR, or that might have potential conflicts of interest, were reported.
*   Prior omnibus approval was obtained for repetitive transactions, and all related party transactions were placed before the Audit Committee.
*   Disclosures are provided in Note 25 (Consolidated) and Note 27 (Standalone) and Form AOC-2 (Annexure IV to Directors' Report).

### Subsequent Events

*   The Board of Directors approved the financial statements on May 3, 2024. No other subsequent events requiring disclosure or adjustment were reported in the notes (Note 35 Consolidated, Note 36 Standalone).

### Accounting Quality Analysis

*   The accounting quality appears reasonable, adhering to Ind AS principles.
*   Key Audit Matters highlight areas requiring significant management judgment and estimation, particularly in revenue recognition for un-invoiced amounts (reliant on quantifying service units and applying correct pricing/variable considerations), goodwill impairment (dependent on future cash flow forecasts, growth rates, and discount rates), and the recoverability of MAT credit (reliant on forecasts of future taxable profits, especially from SEZ units).
*   The consistent application of accounting policies is noted. The auditors have issued unmodified opinions, indicating the financial statements present a true and fair view despite these inherent estimation uncertainties.
*   The noted exception regarding the audit trail not being enabled at the database level, while not resulting in observed tampering, represents a weakness in the control environment around the accounting software.

### Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   Regulatory risk appears moderate.
*   Compliance with major regulations (Companies Act, SEBI LODR) is confirmed by auditors and secretarial auditors. Internal controls over financial reporting are deemed adequate and effective.
*   However, substantial pending tax litigations (Income Tax and Service Tax) represent a specific area of regulatory risk. While management is confident of favorable outcomes and provisions are deemed adequate, adverse rulings could have a financial impact.
*   The noted exception regarding the audit trail at the database level, while compliant with rules effective from April 1, 2023, could attract scrutiny regarding the robustness of IT controls around financial records if not fully addressed prospectively.
*   The need for shareholder approval for the continuation of directors aged over 75 (Mr. Pradip Kumar Khaitan) and those serving long terms without recent shareholder approval (Dr. Sanjiv Goenka) reflects adherence to recent SEBI amendments, mitigating governance risks in this area.
