## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis examines Vadilal Industries Limited's (VIL) annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, focusing on financial performance, business segments, risks, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

VIL reported a marginal increase in revenue from operations (1.77%) to ₹912.57 crore in FY2024 compared to ₹896.71 crore in FY2023.  Including other income (₹13.21 crore), total income reached ₹925.78 crore.  Profit before tax (PBT) showed a more substantial increase, rising from ₹96.48 crore to ₹128.57 crore, primarily due to improved operational efficiency and marginal revenue growth.  After tax profit was ₹95.84 crore, up from ₹71.93 crore in the previous year. This improvement, however, is partly offset by a higher tax expense in FY2024 (₹32.73 crore vs. ₹24.55 crore).

**Key Financial Highlights (₹ in crore):**

| Metric                     | FY2024      | FY2023      | Change (%) |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Revenue from Operations     | 912.57      | 896.71      | 1.77       |
| Other Income                | 13.21       | 12.24       | 7.93       |
| Total Income                | 925.78      | 908.95      | 1.85       |
| Total Expenses              | 797.21      | 812.47      | -1.87      |
| Profit Before Tax (PBT)    | 128.57      | 96.48       | 33.23      |
| Tax Expense                 | 32.73       | 24.55       | 33.29      |
| Profit After Tax (PAT)      | 95.84       | 71.93       | 33.23      |
| Total Detailed Income | 94.47       | 70.66       | 33.75      |
| EPS (Basic & Diluted)      | 133.34      | 100.09      | 33.23      |

**Financial Ratios (Note:  Calculations based on provided data may differ slightly from the report's due to rounding):**

The report provides some ratios, but a more complete analysis requires additional data (e.g., average equity, working capital).  The provided ratios show a mixed picture: improved profitability (ROE) but decreased turnover ratios (inventory, receivables, net capital). The significantly improved debt-equity ratio is positive, signifying reduced financial leverage.

**II. Business Segments:**

VIL operates in two main segments:

* **Ice Cream Division:** This is the larger segment, contributing approximately 90% of the turnover.  VIL is the second-largest ice cream brand in India, focusing on both impulse purchases (cones, bars, cups) and premium offerings (gourmet tubs, cakes).  They have a wide distribution network and actively engage in marketing and brand building campaigns (Dil Bole Waah Vadilal!).
* **Processed Food Division:** This division contributes about 10% of the revenue, focusing on exporting processed frozen fruits and vegetables.  This segment uses the existing cold chain infrastructure of the ice cream division.

**III. Risks:**

The report highlights many risks:

* **Competition:** The Indian ice cream market is highly competitive, with both established international and local brands. VIL's strategy focuses on innovation, premiumization, and strong brand building to maintain its market share.
* **Unorganized Market:** The significant unorganized sector in both ice cream and processed foods poses a challenge through price competition and potentially lower quality standards.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  Rising energy costs, raw material availability (impact of climate change), and potential supply chain disruptions a/ffect both divisions.
* **Raw Material Prices:** Fluctuations in the prices of milk and other raw materials are a significant concern.
* **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in food safety regulations and taxation could impact profitability.
* **Economic Downturn:** A general economic slowdown can reduce consumer spending and impact demand.
* **Internal Disputes:**  The report mentions past internal disputes between promoter directors and the pending receipt of conclusive reports related to potential misstatements in financial reporting.  This is a significant governance risk.

**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

VIL's Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) provides detail on their ESG performance, focusing on the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC).  While the report acknowledges many initiatives, it is still largely qualitative, lacking in quantifiable targets and progress measurements for many key areas.  Key takeaways:

* **Environmental:** The company focuses on energy conservation (solar power, VFDs), water e/fficiency improvements, and waste management (plastic reduction through mono-layer laminate).  However, concrete emission reduction targets are absent, and Scope 3 emissions are only mentioned qualitatively.
* **Social:**  Employee well-being is prioritized through health insurance and other benefits, but data on diversity and inclusion is limited.   There is a stated commitment to responsible sourcing, but the percentage of sustainably sourced inputs is only provided for the processed food division.  There is mention of a grievance redressal mechanism but no detailed data on complaints received or resolved.
* **Governance:** The report details the composition and activities of various board committees (audit, nomination & remuneration, stakeholder relations, CSR, risk management).  However, the mention of past internal disputes is a cause for concern, and greater transparency in resolving these matters is needed.

**V. Overall Assessment:**

VIL demonstrates financial stability and profitability, but the growth is moderate.  Their reliance on the larger ice cream division needs to be balanced with growth in the processed food sector.  The company's strategy of premiumization and innovation in the ice cream market appears viable.  The reported internal disputes represent a significant governance risk that requires immediate and transparent attention to rebuild stakeholder trust. While the BRSR outlines some ESG commitments, the lack of quantifiable targets and specific measurable outcomes limits the overall assessment of their sustainability performance.  A stronger focus on quantifiable ESG targets and detailed reporting on progress is essential for future sustainability and investor confidence.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
Based on the provided Vadilal Industries Limited annual report, here are the values of the requested financial metrics as of **March 31, 2024**, in Indian Rupees (₹ crore):

* **Total Assets:** ₹645.24 crore
* **Total Current Assets:** ₹281.44 crore
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹0.61 crore
* **Trade Receivables (Accounts Receivable):** ₹57.70 crore
* **Inventories:** ₹189.93 crore


**Important Note:** These figures are from the *standalone* financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements would include the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, resulting in likely higher values for total assets and the other metrics.

### Liability Analysis
Here are the values for the requested liabilities of Vadilal Industries Limited as of **March 31, 2024**, in Indian Rupees (₹ crore), based on the provided standalone financial statements:

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹262.64 crore
* **Total Current Liabilities:** ₹186.53 crore
* **Long-term Debt:**  This requires some calculation.  Note 19 shows a total of ₹33.10 crore in non-current borrowings *after* deducting current maturities.  Therefore, the total long-term debt *before* deducting current maturities is  ₹33.10 crore + ₹14.86 crore (current maturities of long-term loans) + ₹0.23 crore (current maturities of vehicle loans) = ₹48.19 crore. Note that public fixed deposits are also long-term, however, the company shows the current portion separately, so the correct figure is ₹48.19 crore.
* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** ₹78.79 crore


**Important Note:**  These figures are from the *standalone* financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements would include the liabilities of subsidiaries, resulting in likely different values for total liabilities and the other metrics.  Also, the long-term debt figure is a calculated value and could slightly vary based on how "long-term" is interpreted from the data provided in different notes.

### Equity Analysis
Here are the values for the requested shareholder equity components of Vadilal Industries Limited as of **March 31, 2024**, in Indian Rupees (₹ crore), based on the provided standalone financial statements:


* **Total Equity:** ₹382.60 crore
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹249.66 crore
* **Share Capital:** ₹7.19 crore (This represents the equity share capital; other equity components make up the remaining equity)

**Important Note:** These figures are from the *standalone* financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements would show different values, as they include the equity of subsidiary companies.  The share capital figure only represents the par value of the issued shares;  the total equity includes additional paid-in capital (securities premium) and other reserves.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Here's a summary of Vadilal Industries Limited's income statement data for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, in Indian Rupees (₹ crore), based on the provided standalone financial statements:

* **Revenue:** ₹912.57 crore (This is revenue from operations)
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹495.40 crore (Cost of Materials Consumed) + ₹11.95 crore (Purchase of Stock-in-trade) + ₹18.14 crore (Changes in Inventories of Finished Goods and Stock-in-trade) = ₹525.49 crore
* **Gross Profit:** Revenue - Cost of Revenue = ₹912.57 crore - ₹525.49 crore = ₹387.08 crore
* **Operating Expenses:** This requires summing many line items from the income statement: Employee Benefits Expense (₹63.62 crore), Finance Costs (₹13.97 crore), Depreciation and Amortization Expenses (₹23.15 crore), and Other Expenses (₹170.98 crore).  Therefore, operating expenses total ₹271.72 crore.
* **Operating Income:** Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = ₹387.08 crore - ₹271.72 crore = ₹115.36 crore


**Important Note:** The "Cost of Revenue" calculation here is an approximation. The provided income statement presents inventory changes in a way that makes a precise calculation slightly ambiguous.  Furthermore,  these figures are from the *standalone* financial statements. The consolidated financial statements would show different values due to the inclusion of subsidiary company data.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Based on the provided standalone financial statements for Vadilal Industries Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024:

* **Net Income:** ₹95.84 crore (Profit for the year)
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):**  This requires calculation.  Start with Profit After Tax (₹95.84 crore), then add back tax expenses (₹32.73 crore), interest expense (₹13.97 crore), and depreciation and amortization (₹23.15 crore).  Therefore, EBITDA is approximately ₹165.69 crore.
* **Basic EPS:** ₹133.34
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹133.34 (The report states there were no potential dilutive securities, so basic and diluted EPS are the same).

**Important Note:** These figures are from the *standalone* financial statements. Consolidated figures would differ due to the inclusion of subsidiary data.  The EBITDA calculation is an approximation, as some items may be considered operating expenses under different accounting standards.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on the standalone statement of cash flows for Vadilal Industries Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024:


* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹137.85 crore
* **Investing Cash Flow:** ₹(40.77) crore (negative, indicating net cash outflow)
* **Financing Cash Flow:** ₹(102.19) crore (negative, indicating net cash outflow)

**Important Note:** These are figures from the *standalone* statement of cash flows.  The consolidated statement of cash flows would include the cash flows of subsidiary companies, resulting in different values.  The parentheses around the numbers for Investing and Financing cash flows denote that these represent net cash *outflows*.

### Cash Flow Metrics
To calculate free cash flow (FCF), we need to use data from the standalone statement of cash flows.  Free cash flow is typically calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹137.85 crore (from the standalone cash flow statement)
* **Capital Expenditure:**  This isn't explicitly stated as a single line item but can be inferred. The investing cash flow section shows capital expenditure on Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets of ₹(43.32) crore.
* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure = ₹137.85 crore - ₹43.32 crore = ₹94.53 crore

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹1.08 crore (from Note 18a under the standalone statement of changes in equity)


**Important Note:**  These figures are from the *standalone* financial statements. The consolidated figures will differ because they will encompass subsidiary company data.  The Capital Expenditure figure is derived from the investing activities section and may not perfectly align with all definitions of CAPEX depending on the specific accounting practices of the company.

### Profitability Ratios
To calculate the profitability ratios for Vadilal Industries Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we'll use the standalone financial statement data.  Keep in mind that these calculations are based on the numbers we derived earlier; slight discrepancies might exist compared to the company's official report due to rounding differences.


* **Gross Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹387.08 crore / ₹912.57 crore) * 100 ≈ 42.4%
* **Operating Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹115.36 crore / ₹912.57 crore) * 100 ≈ 12.6%
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹95.84 crore / ₹912.57 crore) * 100 ≈ 10.5%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholder Equity) * 100.  We need the average shareholder equity for a precise calculation (beginning and ending equity values are needed, which aren't directly provided in this simplified summary). The annual report states ROE as 28.53%, but we do not have enough information to independently calculate and verify that figure.
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100. Similar to ROE, we need the average total assets (beginning and ending values) for a precise calculation.  The annual report states ROA as 14.56%, but we do not have enough information to independently calculate and verify that figure.


**Important Note:** These calculations rely on our earlier approximations of Gross Profit and Operating Income.  The precise values in the official annual report might show small variations due to rounding and possible differences in accounting treatment. Also, to accurately calculate ROE and ROA, the average values of shareholder equity and total assets for the year are necessary, which aren't directly provided in the simplified information.  Always use the company's official reported figures for the most accurate financial analysis.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate the liquidity ratios for Vadilal Industries Limited as of March 31, 2024, we'll use the standalone balance sheet data. Remember that these calculations are based on previously derived values, so minor discrepancies might arise due to rounding:

* **Current Ratio:** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹281.44 crore / ₹186.53 crore ≈ 1.51
* **Quick Ratio:** [(Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities] = (₹281.44 crore - ₹189.93 crore) / ₹186.53 crore ≈ 0.49
* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = ₹0.61 crore / ₹186.53 crore ≈ 0.0033


**Important Note:** These calculations use the standalone balance sheet data and our previously calculated values for current assets and current liabilities.  The consolidated balance sheet would produce different results.  Always use the company's official reported figures for the most accurate financial analysis.  Also, note that the cash ratio is extremely low, which may indicate a potential liquidity risk for the company. This warrants further investigation.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating efficiency ratios requires data not fully provided in the simplified summary of Vadilal Industries' financial statements.  We need average values (average inventory, average receivables, average total assets)  for accurate calculations.  The provided annual report gives some of these ratios, but not enough information to independently calculate and verify them.  We can only provide the formulas needed for calculation, along with the available data points to illustrate how these would be computed.


* **Asset Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Total Assets).  We need the average total assets (beginning and ending values from the balance sheet) for this calculation.  The report shows a value for this, but we need the complete balance sheet to independently verify it.


* **Inventory Turnover:** (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory).  We have an ending inventory value (₹189.93 crore) from the balance sheet, but to calculate the average, we'd need the beginning inventory value.  We also need the cost of goods sold (COGS), which isn't explicitly stated but is calculable from the income statement data (though it requires a clarification on the accounting of inventory changes as mentioned earlier).  The report shows a value for this ratio, but we lack the data to verify this.

* **Receivables Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable). Similar to the other two ratios, calculating this requires the beginning and ending balances for accounts receivable.  The report provides a value but without full data, we cannot verify it.


**In summary:** The formulas are provided above, but without complete data from the full annual report, a precise and independently verified calculation of these efficiency ratios is not possible. Always rely on the company's official calculations for the most accurate financial analysis.

### Leverage Ratios
Calculating use ratios for Vadilal Industries Limited as of March 31, 2024, requires data from both the balance sheet and income statement.  We'll use the standalone figures we calculated earlier, acknowledging potential minor discrepancies due to rounding:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** (Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity).  We'll use the approximate total debt figure from our previous analysis (₹111.37 crore - net debt). Total shareholder's equity is ₹382.60 crore.  Therefore, the Debt-to-Equity ratio is approximately (₹111.37 crore / ₹382.60 crore) ≈ 0.29.

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** (Total Debt / Total Assets) = ₹111.37 crore / ₹645.24 crore ≈ 0.17

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense).  We need to calculate EBIT first. We can use the provided PBT (₹128.57 crore) and add back the interest expense (₹13.97 crore), resulting in EBIT of approximately ₹142.54 crore. Interest Expense is given as ₹13.97 crore.  Therefore, the Interest Coverage Ratio is approximately (₹142.54 crore / ₹13.97 crore) ≈ 10.2


**Important Note:** These calculations use our previous approximations for debt and other financial metrics. The consolidated financial statements would yield different results.  It is essential to use the company's officially reported figures for a precise analysis.  Also, remember that the reported interest expense is from standalone data and might slightly change upon consolidation.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
Several of these market-based ratios cannot be calculated from the information provided in the annual report alone.  The annual report gives fundamental accounting data, but to compute market-based metrics, we need current market data (share price, number of outstanding shares).

* **Market Cap:** (Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares).  This requires the current market price per share, which is not available in the provided annual report.

* **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):** (Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share). This calculation also needs the current market price per share, which is unavailable.

* **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):** (Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share). The book value per share can be approximated from the balance sheet data (shareholder's equity / number of shares), but the market price per share is missing.

* **Dividend Yield:** (Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share) * 100.  The annual dividend per share (₹1.50) is available in the report, but the market price per share is required for calculation.

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100 = (₹1.08 crore / ₹95.84 crore) * 100 ≈ 1.13%.


**In summary:**  Only the dividend payout ratio could be calculated from the provided data.  The other ratios require the current market price per share, which is not included in this annual report.  To calculate these market-based ratios, you must obtain the current market price per share from a financial data provider.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The provided annual report only gives limited segment information.  While it clearly identifies two business segments, detailed breakdowns of revenue, growth rates, operating margins, and market shares aren't available for each segment.  Also, geographic presence is only mentioned qualitatively.


**Business Segments:**

1. **Ice Cream Division:**

* **Name:** Ice Cream Division
* **Revenues:**  Approximately 90% of total revenue (₹821.31 crore, calculated as 90% of ₹912.57 crore standalone revenue). The exact figure is not explicitly provided.
* **Growth Rate:** Not explicitly stated for this segment alone; overall revenue growth was 1.77%.
* **Operating Margin:** Not explicitly stated for this segment; the overall standalone operating margin is approximately 12.6%.
* **Market Share:** The report indicates VIL holds a 16% share of the *organized* Indian ice cream market. This is not a total market share, as it excludes the significant unorganized sector.
* **Key Products:** A wide range of ice creams, including impulse items (cones, bars, cups) and premium products (gourmet tubs, cakes, artisan ice cream cakes).  Specific product revenue breakdowns aren't available.
* **Geographic Presence:** Pan-India, with an extensive distribution network.

2. **Processed Food Division:**

* **Name:** Processed Food Division
* **Revenues:** Approximately 10% of total revenue (₹91.26 crore, calculated as 10% of ₹912.57 crore standalone revenue.  The exact figure is not provided.
* **Growth Rate:** Not explicitly stated for this segment alone; overall revenue growth was 1.77%.
* **Operating Margin:** Not explicitly stated for this segment; the overall standalone operating margin is approximately 12.6%.
* **Market Share:** Not provided.
* **Key Products:** Frozen fruits, vegetables, and other processed food products, primarily for export.
* **Geographic Presence:** Primarily export-oriented; the report mentions exports to 24 countries.


**Limitations:** The financial statements lack a detailed segmental breakdown.  The data above relies on the approximate percentages of total revenue mentioned in the annual report, which means calculations based on these figures may not be perfectly accurate. To obtain a precise and complete analysis of each segment's performance, a more detailed segmental report would be required.



## Risk Management
### Risk Assessment
The provided annual report does not offer a structured risk assessment framework with detailed likelihood and impact severity ratings for each risk.  However, we can categorize and describe the key risk factors mentioned, along with some inferred mitigation strategies and trends:


**I. Key Risk Factors:**

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal Disputes | Past internal disputes between promoter directors, potentially impacting operational efficiency and investor trust. | Transparent and independent investigation, robust corporate governance practices. | Requires sustained improvement in governance and transparency.          |
| Regulatory Compliance | Failure to comply with complex and evolving food safety regulations, tax laws, and other legal requirements.     | Robust compliance mechanisms, legal counsel, regular audits.                 | Increasing complexity and stricter enforcement.                     |


**II.  Impact Severity and Likelihood:**

The annual report lacks quantifiable data for assessing likelihood and severity.  A detailed risk assessment would require such information, including probabilities of different scenarios and the potential financial implications.  Qualitative assessments could be made by expert review of the company's operations and competitive landscape.

**III. Mitigation Strategies:**

The report mentions many strategies, but a full risk mitigation plan would require a more detailed view of both the risks and the steps taken to mitigate them.

**IV. Trends:**

The described trends are mostly qualitative, indicating growing competition, increasing complexity in regulatory compliance, and the need for continuous investment in infrastructure and technology to support business growth and sustainability initiatives. The future impact of these trends depends largely on external factors, such as economic conditions and government policies.  A more rigorous analysis of industry trends and competitor strategies would be needed to provide more precise trend forecasts.

To find ESG ratings for Vadilal Industries Limited, you would need to consult these specialized ESG rating agencies directly or use financial data platforms that provide such ratings.

### ESG Initiatives

**II. Carbon Footprint:**

The annual report does *not* provide a detailed calculation or disclosure of the company's carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions).  The BRSR mentions e/fforts to reduce overall emissions, but this lacks any quantifiable data.

**V. Sustainability Goals:**

The annual report does *not* explicitly state quantifiable sustainability goals or targets.  The report focuses on qualitative statements about their commitment to sustainability, but it lacks speci/fic, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives.  This is a considerable limitation for assessing their long-term sustainability strategy.
