| Metric                         | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 |
|--------------------------------| ---------- | ---------- |
| Current Ratio                  | 3.48       | 4.22      |
| Cash and Cash Equivalents (INR mn)|4,032.77  |  3,824.37        |
| Cash Conversion Cycle (est.) #| ~ 76 Days | ~ 76 Days|

*# Note:* Estimated based on available inventory, receivable, and payable turnover data. A precise CCC requires detailed cost of goods sold data.

Because Free Cash Flow and Market Capitalization data has varied, this section cannot be fully analyzed.

### Peer Comparison

A meaningful peer comparison requires identifying publicly listed companies with similar business models (OTC, Rx, geographic focus). This data is not provided in the provided annual report extract. A peer comparison would normally include the same metrics calculated above for comparable companies.

### Forward Projections (Based on Historical Trends)

**Without specific growth rates or management guidance**, a rudimentary projection can be made:

*   **Revenue:** Assuming continued growth, but possibly moderating from the high teens, a conservative estimate could be 10-15% growth.
*   **OCF:** Likely to grow in line with revenue, assuming stable margins. However, working capital needs could impact this.
*   **Capex:** Difficult to project without specific investment plans. The large acquisitions in recent years may not be repeated annually.
*   **Dividends:** If the company maintains a payout ratio, dividends would increase with net income.
*   **FCF:** Dependent on the interplay of OCF and Capex.

**Important Considerations:**

*   These projections are highly simplistic and based *solely* on the limited historical data provided.
*   No account is taken of external factors (market conditions, regulatory changes, competition, etc.).
*   No specific management guidance or strategic plans are incorporated.
*The acquisition of Tevapharm's Goa facility represents a significant strategic move.
*   The annual report indicates a focus on both OTC and Rx markets, and continued expansion in regulated markets.

It should be added that The Red Sea crisis presented challenges, directly impacting the company's cost structure through increased transit times and freight rates.

*   The Interest Coverage Ratio is exceptionally high, meaning the company has more than sufficient earnings to cover its interest obligations.

## Segment-wise ROIC
