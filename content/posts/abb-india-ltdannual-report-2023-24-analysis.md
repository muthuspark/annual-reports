## ABB India Limited - Financial Analysis (FY 2024)

### Cash Flow Analysis

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Net cash flow from operating activities was ₹1,709 Crores. This was generated primarily from profit before tax (₹2,509 Crores), adjusted for non-cash items (like depreciation/amortization of ₹185 Crores and loss allowance of ₹81 Crores) and offset by interest income (₹303 Crores). Working capital movements also influenced OCF, with notable changes in trade payables, trade receivables, and inventories. Income taxes paid amounted to ₹639 Crores.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash used in investing activities was substantial at ₹3,027 Crores. Key activities included the purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (₹165 Crores) and significant net investment in bank deposits with maturities over three months (Net outflow of ₹7,154 Cr inflow vs ₹6,513 Cr outflow = ₹641 Cr net outflow from this specific activity, although the summary shows a much larger net figure likely due to large gross flows not fully detailed). Interest received contributed ₹303 Crores.
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Net cash used in financing activities was ₹730 Crores, dominated by dividend payments (₹730 Crores) and payments for lease liabilities (principal ₹40.14 Cr, interest ₹5.43 Cr).

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Debtors Turnover:** Decreased slightly to 4.41x in FY2024 from 4.51x in FY2023, indicating a marginal slowdown in receivable collection efficiency relative to turnover.
*   **Inventory Turnover:** Decreased to 4.25x in FY2024 from 4.43x in FY2023, suggesting slightly slower inventory movement relative to turnover. Strategic inventory management was noted as supporting backlog execution.
*   **Payables Management:** Accounts payable days increased slightly to 115 days in FY2024 from 112 days in FY2023.
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** Data provided in the excerpts is insufficient to calculate the full CCC. However, the available turnover ratios suggest a potential slight lengthening of the cycle.
*   **Overall:** Working capital management appears stable, supporting operations despite minor efficiency shifts. The company maintained a positive cash position throughout the year.

### Capital Expenditure (Capex) Analysis

*   **Total Capex (PPE Purchase):** The Statement of Cash Flows indicates ₹165 Crores was spent on purchasing Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) in FY2024.
*   **Segment Capex (Based on Segment Notes):**
    *   Electrification: ₹81.29 Crores
    *   Motion: ₹25.52 Crores
    *   Process Automation: ₹34.30 Crores
    *   Robotics & Discrete Automation: ₹9.11 Crores
    *   *Note:* The sum of segmented capex reported (₹150.22 Cr) differs slightly from the total PPE purchase figure in the cash flow statement, potentially due to unallocated/corporate capex or timing.
*   **Key Investments:** Upgradation and expansion occurred at Faridabad (motors factory/office), Nashik (GIS shopfloors), and Nelamangala (admin building). Vadodara saw office/warehouse modernization.

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividends:**
    *   FY2024: Total Dividend ₹730 Crores (₹44.16 per share - ₹10.66 interim + ₹33.50 proposed final). This represents a 51% YoY increase in payout.
    *   FY2023: Total Dividend ₹233 Crores (₹29.3 per share).
    *   Trend: Significant upward trend in dividend per share and total payout over the last five years (FY20: ₹5 DPS, FY21: ₹5.2 DPS, FY22: ₹5.5 DPS, FY23: ₹29.3 DPS, FY24: ₹44.16 DPS), reflecting strong profit growth. The Dividend Distribution Policy is in place.
*   **Share Buybacks:** The company has not undertaken any share buybacks during the reporting period or the preceding five years. Share capital has remained constant.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   **Debt Position:** The company reported no borrowings for the past five years (FY2020-FY2024). The Debt-Equity ratio is 0.00:1.
*   **Traditional DSCR:** Not applicable due to the absence of interest-bearing borrowings.
*   **Lease Liability Coverage (Proxy):** Lease liabilities exist (Non-current ₹66.32 Cr, Current ₹36.45 Cr). A proxy coverage ratio [(PBIT + Lease Interest) / (Lease Principal Payments + Lease Interest Payments)] can be calculated: (₹2,525 Cr + ₹5.43 Cr) / (₹40.14 Cr + ₹5.43 Cr) ≈ 55.5x. This indicates a very high capacity to cover lease payment obligations from operating profit.

### Liquidity Position

*   **Cash Balance:** Strong liquidity with Cash and Cash Equivalents at ₹294 Crores and Other Bank Balances (including deposits > 3 months) at ₹4,802 Crores as of Dec 31, 2024. The MDA mentions a total net cash balance (including fixed deposits) of ₹5,390 Crores.

Fixed-price contracts use the percentage-of-completion method based on cost incurred relative to total estimated costs. Service revenue also uses percentage-of-completion. Provisions made for foreseeable losses.
*   **Impairment (Note 2.12):** Financial assets assessed using ECL model (simplified approach for trade receivables). Non-financial assets (PPE, Intangibles) tested when impairment indicators exist or annually for goodwill.
*   **Provisions & Contingencies (Note 2.14):** Provisions recognized for present obligations from past events where outflow is probable and estimable (e.g., warranties, onerous contracts, litigation). Contingent liabilities disclosed but not recognized.
*   **Leases (Note 2.22):** Follows Ind AS 116, recognizing Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases, depreciating ROU assets over lease term/useful life. Short-term and low-value leases expensed on a straight-line basis.

#### Critical Estimates & Judgments
Significant estimation is involved in project revenue/costs (percentage-of-completion), provisions for litigation/contingencies, ECL on trade receivables, and warranty provisions.

#### Changes
No new standards or amendments applicable for the financial year starting January 1, 2025, were notified by MCA as of the report date. No significant voluntary changes in accounting policy were highlighted for the current year. (Ref: Note 2.23)

### Internal Control Effectiveness

#### Auditor's Opinion on IFC
The auditors issued an unqualified opinion stating the company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls (IFC) with reference to financial statements, and such controls were operating effectively as of December 31, 2024. (Ref: Annexure B, Pg 211)

#### Management Assessment and Framework
Management and the Board assert responsibility for establishing, maintaining, and assessing the effectiveness of IFC. (Ref: Auditor's Report Pg 203, Annexure B Pg 211) The Directors' Responsibility Statement confirms adequate IFC and operating effectiveness. (Ref: Board's Report Pg 97) The company employs a framework aligned with COSO principles and compliant with IFC requirements under the Act, supported by internal audit and assurance processes. (Ref: MD&A Pg 154)

#### Identified Deficiency
Notwithstanding the overall unqualified opinion on IFC, the auditors specifically noted deficiencies in the implementation and operation of the audit trail (edit log) feature in certain accounting software for specific periods/functions, as detailed in section 1 above. This indicates a control gap concerning record-keeping integrity and compliance with Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014. (Ref: Auditor's Report Para 2B(f), Pg 205)

### Regulatory Compliance Status

#### Audit Reports

It also notes proper Board processes and compliance mechanisms. No qualifications were noted. (Ref: Annexure D, Pg 103)
*   **SEBI LODR Compliance:** The Annual Secretarial Compliance Report confirms compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and related circulars/guidelines. (Ref: Annexure E, Pg 106) The Corporate Governance Compliance Certificate also confirms compliance with mandatory Corporate Governance conditions. (Ref: Annexure G, Pg 138)

#### Statutory Dues
Auditors report that undisputed statutory dues (GST, PF, ESI, Income Tax, Customs, Cess) have generally been regularly deposited. No undisputed amounts were in arrears for more than six months. Details of disputed dues are provided. (Ref: Annexure A Para vii, Pg 209)

#### Companies Act Compliance
Auditors confirm compliance with requirements regarding disclosure of pending litigations, provisions for foreseeable losses, IEPF transfers, director disqualifications, dividend payment, and related party transaction provisions (Sec 177/188). (Ref: Auditor's Report Para 2, Pg 203-205, Annexure A Para xiii, Pg 210) Compliance with applicable Secretarial Standards is affirmed. (Ref: Board'
