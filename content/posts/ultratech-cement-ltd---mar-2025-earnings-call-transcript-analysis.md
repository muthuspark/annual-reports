## Financial Performance

### Key Metrics (New Venture - Cables & Wires)

*   Planned CAPEX: Rs. 1,800 crores.
*   Projected Asset Turn: 5-7x (implying potential peak revenue of Rs. 9,000-12,600 Cr).
*   Projected ROCE/IRR: "upwards of 25%".
*   Projected EBITDA Margins: "akin to the industry" at maturity. Initial margins expected to be lower during ramp-up.
*   Working Capital Target: Aiming for minimal or potentially negative working capital, leveraging UltraTech's scale.
    *   Quote: *"Ambition is like UltraTech, like a cement business, we will want to be negative working capital."*

### Comparison

*   No direct comparison to past performance provided for the new C&W venture as it is pre-launch. Financial targets are benchmarked against industry norms.

### Guidance (Cement)

*   The CFO reiterated ongoing cement CAPEX of Rs. 20,000-25,000 crores over the next two years, targeting 209 MTPA capacity by FY27. Cement capital employed projected to reach ~Rs. 1 lakh crore by the time C&W operations mature.

### Areas of Growth

*   The entire call focuses on the new growth vector represented by the Cables & Wires (C&W) business, projecting double-digit industry growth. Continued strong growth outlook for the core cement business was also reaffirmed.
    *   Quote: *"India has a long runway for cement... We have been growing faster than industry and will continue to do so..."*

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

### Major Strategic Announcement

*   Entry into the Cables and Wires (C&W) market.
    *   Quote: *"Cables and Wires came right on top as the only strategic extension as these products are on the back of the wall which we are already presently building."*

### Rationale

Presented as a strategic adjacency leveraging existing strengths:

*   Shared Customer Base: High overlap with cement in residential (IHB, Urban Housing) and infrastructure segments.
    *   Quote: *"Wire segment, almost 85% of wires market is covered by the residential markets and 65% of cement demand comes from the residential market."*
*   Distribution Synergy: Utilizing existing contractor relationships, UltraTech Business Solutions (UBS) retail stores, and B2B connections with builders/EPC players.
    *   Quote: *"UltraTech connects with corporate real estate players alike as well as the EPC players and hence we thought it prudent..."*
*   Brand Leverage: Capitalizing on the recognized and respected UltraTech brand.

### New Products/Markets

*   Launching Cables and Wires. Production planned to go live by December 2026. Focus initially on Low Tension (LT) cables and wires (approx. 60% Wires / 40% Cables revenue mix target).

### Operational Changes

*   Establishing a new manufacturing facility in Jhagadiya, Gujarat. Building a dedicated team with specialists for the C&W business, while leveraging some existing 'generalist' functions.
    *   Quote: *"No, there will be specialists and there will be generalists... But there will be specialists who manufacture, who know the tech part..."*

### Excluded Adjacencies

*   Management explicitly stated evaluation and rejection of other categories like pipes, tiles, wood adhesives, sanitary fittings, lights, and fans as not being strategic fits. Assurance given against entering these in the near term (3-5 years).
    *   Quote: *"We examined multiple other adjacencies... and dropped all these product categories because they were not a strategic fit."*

### Ongoing Projects (Cement)

*   Expansion plans on track to reach 182.8 MTPA by end-FY25 and 209 MTPA by end-FY27.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends (C&W)

*   Market growing at double digits ("13%-14% CAGR" mentioned), expected to continue. Driven by housing, infrastructure (metros, airports, railways), renewable energy, and EV projects. Urbanization and white goods penetration boost wire demand.

### Competitive Positioning (C&W)

*   Acknowledges established players and significant recent capacity additions by incumbents. However, UltraTech believes its brand, distribution network (UBS, 135k+ touchpoints), B2B relationships, and technical services intel provide a strong "right to win". Positioned as an additional player in a growing market.
    *   Quote: *"we believe there is room for one additional player."* and *"I think it is the UltraTech advantage which will come to play."*

### Market Challenges/Opportunities (C&W)

*   Opportunity lies in the high market growth and synergies. Challenge is entering a market with strong incumbents. Addressed analyst concerns about potential pricing pressure due to capacity additions by stating belief in market growth absorbing capacity.
    *   Quote: *"don't think it requires any price, there will be any pressure on prices. And with the growing market, we will also be able to find our place."*

### Market Share (Cement)

*   Current capacity represents ~28% of industry; aim to maintain/grow leadership.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Capital Allocation Concerns

*   Addressed analyst concerns about diverting focus/capital from the core cement business by highlighting the relatively small scale of the initial C&W CAPEX (Rs. 1,800 Cr) compared to cement (~Rs. 1 lakh Cr capital employed projected) and emphasizing its strategic fit.
    *   Quote: *"By the time these Cables and Wires operations peak, cement capital employed will be almost 1 lakh crore against the stated Rs. 1,800 crores CAPEX required for this business."*

### Execution Risk

*   Entering a new manufacturing domain requires successful setup, ramp-up, technology integration (partnerships planned), and building a specialized team.

### Competitive Response

*   Incumbents may react aggressively to a new entrant with UltraTech's scale and brand recognition.

### Initial Performance

*   Acknowledged that initial years (up to FY30/31) will involve ramp-up, brand building, and network establishment, potentially leading to lower margins initially.
    *   Quote: *"Initial year might be much lesser because we would be building, ramping of the capacity and building the network..."*

## Forward-Looking Statements

### Outlook

*   Positive outlook for both core cement business (driven by infra/housing demand) and the new C&W venture (driven by market growth and strategic fit).

### Commitments/Targets

*   C&W production live by Dec 2026.
*   Achieve >25% ROCE/IRR and industry-level margins for C&W by maturity (FY31).
*   Reach 209 MTPA cement capacity by FY27.
*   Contain initial C&W CAPEX phase at Rs. 1,800 Cr.
*   No entry into other evaluated adjacencies for the next 3-5 years.
    *   Quote: *"Next 5 years, next 3 years, next 5 years.
