### Comparison with Previous Periods

*   Q3 revenue grew YoY, but profitability metrics (Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, PAT, and related margins) declined YoY, primarily attributed to changes in volume mix due to banks' spend-based programs and increased hiring costs for expansion.
*   9M revenue showed strong growth, while gross profit also grew. Adjusted EBITDA saw a slight increase, but margins contracted. PAT was marginally lower.

### Revised Guidance or Forecasts

*   Gross margin guidance for FY25 remains 11% to 13%.
*   No specific revised revenue or PAT guidance for FY25 or FY26 was provided beyond outperforming industry growth.

### Areas of Growth or Decline

*   **Growth:** Revenue (Q3 & 9M YoY), contribution from services other than India Airport lounge (increased to 6.9% in 9M FY25 from 5.2% in 9M FY24), client base (13 new enterprise clients, new banking clients).
*   **Decline/Pressure:** Gross margins (Q3 YoY, though 9M FY25 in line with guidance), EBITDA margins (Q3 & 9M YoY), PAT margins (Q3 & 9M YoY). The primary reason cited for margin pressure was "structural change by our bank clients as part of the spend-based program implementation" and "hired top talent in India and out of India, which slightly impacted our margins."
