*   **Accounting Quality:** The unmodified audit opinion suggests a high level of accounting quality. However, the observations regarding property title deeds and the delays in compliance filings, if pervasive or persistent, could raise concerns about the robustness of processes.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** While generally compliant, the FEMA-related delay and the various tax disputes indicate moderate regulatory risk. The pending litigations and unfulfilled conditions related to government grants also contribute to this risk. The company's proactive stance in addressing these issues (e.g., filing appeals, making payments under protest) demonstrates a mitigating approach. Consistent observations by the auditor under clause 2B(f) in respect of non- compliances related to audit-trail may lead to regulatory actions by the authorities.
