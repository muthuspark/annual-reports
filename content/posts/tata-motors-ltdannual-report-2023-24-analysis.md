*   **Commodity Price Sensitivity:** A 10% appreciation/depreciation would result in a pre-tax gain/(loss) of approximately ₹946.85 crores.
*   **Defined Benefit Obligation Sensitivity:** A 1% increase/decrease in the discount rate would decrease/increase obligations by ₹221.10 crores/₹255.87 crores.
