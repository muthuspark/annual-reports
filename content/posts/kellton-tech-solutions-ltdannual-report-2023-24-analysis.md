*Source: Explanatory Statement for Item No 5, 6, 7 (Director Remuneration) & Directors' Report.*
*Note: FY21-22 EBITDA, PBT, PAT calculated based on "Total Revenue" from operations as per the 3-year table. Margins calculated.*

#### Consolidated Financial Highlights (FY24 vs FY23)

*   **Total Revenue from Operations:** Increased to INR 9,82,89,43,631 in FY24 from INR 9,17,32,58,067 in FY23 (7.15% growth).
*   **Profit Before Tax (PBT) and Exceptional Items:** Increased to INR 71,90,65,213 in FY24 from INR 69,79,71,868 in FY23 (3.02% growth).
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT):** Increased to INR 64,01,09,602 in FY24 from INR (1,26,80,88,401) in FY23. The FY23 PAT was significantly impacted by a goodwill write-off of INR 184 crores.

#### Analysis

Standalone revenue shows consistent growth over three years, with a notable acceleration in FY23. EBITDA has also grown, with a stronger increase in FY24, leading to an improved EBITDA margin. However, PBT and PAT saw a dip in FY23 before a modest recovery in FY24, indicating pressure on profitability despite revenue growth during FY23, which appears to have somewhat eased in FY24. Total assets have expanded steadily.

Consolidated performance shows revenue and pre-exceptional PBT growth. The significant turnaround in consolidated PAT in FY24 is primarily due to the absence of the large goodwill write-off that occurred in FY23.

### Business Segment Performance (Consolidated, FY24 vs FY23)

| Segment                | Revenue FY24 (INR) | Revenue FY23 (INR) | YoY Growth | % of Total Revenue FY24 |
| :--------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :--------- | :---------------------- |
| Digital Transformation | 8,06,30,59,042     | 7,51,79,52,021     | 7.25%      | 82.03%                  |
| Enterprise Solutions   | 1,38,40,76,953     | 1,29,23,37,600     | 7.10%      | 14.08%                  |
| Consulting             | 38,18,07,636       | 36,29,68,446       | 5.19%      | 3.89%                   |
| **Total**              | **9,82,89,43,631** | **9,17,32,58,067** | **7.15%**  | **100.00%**             |

*Source: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.*
*Standalone revenue is 100% from Digital Transformation services.*

#### Analysis

Digital Transformation remains the dominant revenue contributor, accounting for over 82% of consolidated revenue and demonstrating healthy growth. Enterprise Solutions also shows comparable growth, maintaining its share. Consulting, while smaller, continues to grow. All segments contributed positively to the overall revenue increase.

### Major Strategic Initiatives and Progress (FY24 Highlights)

Kellton undertook several key initiatives during the year, focusing on securing large projects, expanding service offerings, and enhancing capabilities:

## Risk Framework

### Strategic Risks

#### Market Competition and Economic Downturn

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Severity: High. The IT services industry is highly competitive. Economic downturns globally or in key markets (USA, APAC, Europe) can reduce client IT spending.
    *   Likelihood: Medium. Economic cycles are inherent; competitive pressures are constant.
    *   Trend: Increasing. Global macroeconomic uncertainties and rapid technological shifts intensify competition.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Diversification of service offerings (Digital Transformation, Enterprise Solutions, Consulting), geographic presence (USA, APAC, Europe), focus on high-value projects (LIC, Karnataka Govt), development of new offerings (Design Studio, Kverse, Industrial IOT Software), and efforts to increase customer base and cross-selling.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderate. Diversification and new offerings show proactive measures. The impact of economic downturns can be partially mitigated but not eliminated.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Reduced revenue growth, pressure on margins, project delays or cancellations.
*   **Quantitative Metrics:** Revenue growth (Consolidated: +7.15% YoY to Rs. 982.89 Cr; Standalone: +8.12% YoY to Rs. 184.72 Cr). Dependency on key geographies (USA: ~84.5% of Consolidated Revenue).
*   **YoY Changes:** Slight moderation in consolidated revenue growth compared to potential if economic conditions were stronger.

#### Talent Acquisition, Retention, and Succession

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Severity: High. The IT industry faces a persistent challenge in attracting and retaining skilled talent. Dependence on key managerial personnel (KMPs) also poses a risk.
    *   Likelihood: High.
    *   Trend: Increasing. Competition for specialized skills (AI, digital, HR tech) is intensifying.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOP 2013, proposed amendments), competitive remuneration for KMPs (resolutions for Niranjan Chintam, Krishna Chintam, Karanjit Singh), continuous upskilling programs, fostering a positive work culture, diversity initiatives.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderate. ESOPs and remuneration policies are standard tools. The effectiveness of cultural and upskilling initiatives is qualitative.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Increased employee costs, project delays due to skill gaps, loss of innovation, impact on service delivery if key personnel depart.
*   **Quantitative Metrics:** Employee benefits expense (Standalone: Rs. 128.86 Cr, +5.33% YoY; Consolidated: Rs. 486.78 Cr, +5.01% YoY). Proposed remuneration for KMPs: N.Chintam & K.Chintam up to Rs. 1.2 Cr p.a. each, K.Singh up to Rs. 0.75 Cr p.a. Employee turnover for permanent employees (BRSR FY24): 17.4

## Audit and Compliance Analysis

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The Independent Auditors, Anant Rao & Malik, issued an **unqualified opinion** on both the Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements of Kellton Tech Solutions Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024. They stated that the financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.

#### Standalone Financial Statements

No qualifications were noted. Key Audit Matters (KAMs) highlighted were related to revenue recognition for fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, which involves significant estimation.

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

No qualifications were noted. KAMs were similar, focusing on revenue recognition for fixed-price contracts and impairment testing of goodwill. The "Other Matters" section of the consolidated audit report states that the financial statements of four subsidiaries were not audited by them (three unaudited, one audited by other auditors) and their opinion, in so far as it relates to these subsidiaries, is based solely on such financial statements/information furnished by management. This did not, however, lead to a modification of their overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

### Key Accounting Policies

The company prepares its financial statements in accordance with Ind AS under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments and share-based payments measured at fair value.

*   **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from time and material contracts is recognized as services are rendered. For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on efforts or costs expended relative to total estimated efforts or costs. Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized pro-rata over the contract period.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Goodwill arising on business combinations is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators exist. Other intangible assets (e.g., software licenses) are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and corresponding lease liabilities are recognized for leases, except for short-term and low-value leases. ROU assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund) are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (Gratuity) are accounted for based on actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method, with remeasurements recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).
*   **Share-Based Payments (ESOPs):** Equity-settled ESOPs are fair valued at the grant date and expensed over the vesting period.
*   **Foreign Currency Transactions:** Transactions are recorded at prevailing rates. Monetary assets/liabilities are restated at closing rates, with exchange differences recognized in profit or loss. For foreign operations, translation differences are recognized in OCI.

No significant changes in accounting policies were explicitly reported for the financial year ended March 31, 2024; policies were stated to be consistently applied.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

The auditors issued an **unmodified opinion** on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the company's internal financial controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, for both Standalone operations and for the Company and its Indian subsidiary companies on a consolidated basis. This was based on the criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **Secretarial Audit Report Observations:**
    *   Discrepancy in the total number of shares between MCA records and BSE shareholding patterns as of March 31, 2024, due to listing approvals for ESOP-allotted shares being received in April 2024.
    *   Form IEPF-2 filing was pending approval from MCA (rejected due to "Failed Investor Data Validation").
    *   Certain MCA forms were submitted with late fees, attributed by management to migration issues from MCA V2 to V3 portal.
    *   A penalty of Rs. 1,180 was imposed by NSE and BSE for a one-day delay in complying with Regulation 13(3) of SEBI Listing Regulations concerning investor grievance redressal for Q3 FY2023-24.
    *   A prior year penalty from BSE (FY2022-23) of Rs. 2,12,400 for non-compliance with Regulation 19 was waived by the exchange upon company representation.
*   The Directors' Report affirms compliance with applicable Secretarial Standards (SS-1 and SS-2).
*   The Corporate Governance report states compliance with SEBI (LODR) Regulations.
*   No instances of fraud by or on the company by its officers/employees were reported by the statutory auditors.

### Legal Proceedings and Their Potential Impact

*   The Auditors' Report (Standalone & Consolidated) states that the company/group has disclosed the impact of pending litigations on its financial position.
*   The Notes to both Standalone (Note 40) and Consolidated (Note 42) Financial Statements indicate **Contingent Liabilities as Nil** as at March 31, 2024.
*   The Directors' Report states that there are no significant and material orders passed by regulators or courts impacting the going concern status or future operations.
*   Standalone Note 41 mentions an overdue receivable from Enterprise Consulting Partner, Inc., which management deems recoverable due to an offsetting payable within a subsidiary.
