### Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

*   **CO2-Based Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES):**
    *   Received Notice of Award from NTPC for a 160 MWh LDES system at Kudgi plant.
    *   Contract Value: Approx. ₹2.9 billion.
    *   Scope: Full EPC (Design, Engineering, Fabrication, Erection, Commissioning, Testing).
    *   Technology: CO2 thermodynamic transformation in a closed loop, using an indigenously developed sub-critical CO2 turbine by Triveni. Collaboration with Energy Dome.
    *   Goal: Provide grid stabilization, support renewable energy integration. Seen as an "alternate revenue stream" with significant future potential.
*   **R&D and Technology:**
    *   Increased investment planned in R&D (manpower, capital for testing infrastructure).
    *   Focus areas: Allied CO2 systems (supercritical, transcritical), steam cycle efficiency enhancement, cost reduction (modularisation, supply chain efforts).
    *   Developing digital services as future revenue streams.
    *   Global collaborations with universities and design houses are ongoing.
*   **Market Expansion & Operations:**
    *   **U.S. Market:** Significant investment phase, incurring incubation costs (loss > ₹200 million factored in FY25). Focus on building capabilities, getting certifications, driving service/refurbishment/product sales. Initial signs seen as "very, very encouraging," with breakthrough orders in Q4.
    *   **SADC (South Africa):** Aftermarket presence established, contributing to reduced power outages for utility clients. Order value decreased, but value-add (parts business) and margins are improving.
    *   **Aftermarket Strategy:** Focus shifting to higher value-add refurbishment and parts business for own and third-party turbines globally. Aiming to leverage workshop facilities in India, U.S., and SADC region.
*   **Capacity Expansion:** Planning an additional bay at the Sompura facility for manufacturing and R&D test beds to cater to increased volumes and new products. Capex expected to increase beyond historical levels.
*   **People Strategy:** Strong focus on hiring, training, and capacity building to support growth and innovation. High demand noted for capable service engineers.

### Market & Competitive Landscape

*   **Industry Trends:** Strong demand in renewable energy (waste-to-energy, biomass). Oil & Gas (API market) investment is robust. Industrial heat and power market favors decentralized generation. Sustainable energy transition seen as an opportunity, not a threat, due to fuel-agnostic heat capture technology.
*   **Competitive Positioning:**
    *   Domestic market share estimated around 50%.
    *   Acknowledges intense competition domestically, sometimes leading to backing off on price-sensitive deals.
    *   U.S. market is more competitive than SADC, with established OEMs and third-party providers.
    *   Global Aftermarket share estimated very low indicating significant headroom for growth.
*   **Market Challenges/Opportunities:**
    *   **Domestic:** Subdued Q3 order finalization despite a strong enquiry pipeline. Market size saw degrowth in 9M FY25. Q4 recovery hoped for but cautious outlook due to elections.
    *   **Export:** Strong growth driver, diversifying geographical risk. New geographies and applications contributing. U.S. presents a large, dynamic, but bureaucratic market opportunity.
    *   **Geopolitics/Tariffs:** Management feels "quite agnostic" due to localisation capabilities and largely indigenous supply chain.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Overall positive, driven by export strength, aftermarket potential, and new technology initiatives (CO2). Domestic market softness is the main current concern.

### Risk Factors & Challenges

*   **Domestic Market Slowdown:** Acknowledged subdued order booking in Q3 and overall market degrowth in 9M FY25. Uncertainty around the pace of recovery in Q4/near term.
*   **Competitive Intensity:** High competition, particularly domestically, can pressure pricing and requires focus on value differentiation over price.
*   **U.S. Market Entry Challenges:** Bureaucratic hurdles (permits, certifications) slowing down ramp-up compared to SADC entry. Incurring initial losses ("incubation costs").
