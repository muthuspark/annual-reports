*   **Scenario 2: Increased AI Adoption and Faster tech refresh cycles:** Higher demands in AI and GenAI technologies can bring in more business revenue.
*   **Scenario 3: Currency Fluctuations:** Significant currency depreciation in key markets (especially Turkey, Africa) could negatively impact profitability. Sensitivity analysis would require modeling the impact of various exchange rate scenarios on revenue and costs.
*   **Scenario 4: Increased Interest Rate:** Profitability and cash flow can be negatively impacted if there is a increase in interest rates.
*   **Scenario 5: Supply Chain Disruptions:** Continued or new supply chain disruptions (geopolitical, logistical) could impact product availability and costs. Sensitivity analysis could model the effect of extended lead times and increased freight costs.
* **Scenario 6: Slower Adoption of New Business Models:**
If adoption rates for cloud and subscription models occur at a slower rate.

*   The audit report does not contain any qualifications, observations, or adverse comments.
*   There were delays in filing forms with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, filed with additional fees.
*   Audit trail feature issues were noted for both the Parent Company and subsidiaries.

*   There were no changes in accounting policies during the year.
*   No alternative accounting treatment prescribed differently from Ind AS was adopted.
*   Arena Connect has merged with its parent company during the year.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   The Company has an Internal Financial Controls (IFC) framework, including entity-level controls, efficiency controls, risk controls, fraud preventive controls, and IT general controls.
*   The Board opines that internal controls for the preparation of financial statements are adequate and sufficient.
*   The external auditor's report on internal financial controls expresses an unmodified opinion.
*   Audit trail issues were observed in the accounting software, specifically related to the period when the audit trail feature was not enabled and for software operated by third-party providers.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   The Company has complied with all applicable provisions of Secretarial Standards - 1 and Secretarial Standard - 2.
*   The Company has complied with the requirements of Stock Exchange/SEBI/Statutory Authority on all capital market-related matters.
*   There is compliance with the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, regarding downstream investments.
*   The Company is in the process of filing FC-GPR forms for the allotment. Upon the approval, the Company will make a compounding application.
*   No non-compliance except as stated.

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

*   There are no significant and material orders passed by the Regulators, Courts, or Tribunals impacting the Company's going concern status.
*   There are no pending proceedings against the Company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
*   There are no instances of a one-time settlement with any Bank or Financial Institution.
*   Disputed tax demands exist, and the impact of pending litigations has been disclosed.

*   All transactions with related parties were in the ordinary course of business and at arm's length.

### Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The unmodified audit opinion and the adherence to Ind AS suggest a generally high quality of accounting. However, the issues identified with the audit trail feature in the accounting software, affecting periods within the fiscal year, slightly lowers the accounting quality.
*   **Regulatory Risk Assessment:** The historical instances of delays in filing forms indicate regulatory monitoring risk. The ongoing compliance and the resolution of the tax disputes also contribute to the overall regulatory risk profile. The restatements related to the change in the method of accounting in foreign currency, and the unspent CSR amount being transferred to a special account, also impact regulatory risk. The transfer of the registered office, expansion to new geographies, and internal restructuring also present a moderate regulatory risk.
