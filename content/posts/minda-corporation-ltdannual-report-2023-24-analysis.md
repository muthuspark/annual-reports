## Minda Corporation Limited - Financial Year 2023-24 Performance Analysis

### Overall Financial Performance

Minda Corporation Limited demonstrated resilient financial performance in FY2023-24. Consolidated revenue grew by 8.2% year-on-year (YoY) to ₹46,511 million, primarily driven by robust domestic demand in the two-wheeler (2W) and passenger vehicle (PV) segments, which offset challenges in export markets and subdued demand in the ASEAN region. Standalone revenue saw a 10.08% YoY increase to ₹38,445 million.

EBITDA surged by 11.5% YoY to ₹5,144 million, with the EBITDA margin improving to a record 11.1% from 10.7% in FY2023. This margin expansion is attributed to enhanced operational efficiencies achieved through strategic automation and component localization initiatives.

Consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) for FY2024 was ₹2,272 million, a decrease of 20.14% from ₹2,845 million in FY2023. The PAT margin stood at 4.9%, down from 5.1% in the previous fiscal, influenced by higher finance costs and depreciation stemming from investments in capacity expansion and technological upgrades. Standalone PAT decreased by 21.65% to ₹1,885 million.

A significant achievement was the reduction in net debt from ₹3,910 million in FY2023 to ₹1,560 million in FY2024, leading to an improved net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08x (down from 0.25x). This reflects effective cash flow management and strategic debt repayments. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) for FY2024 was robust at 20.0%.

Shareholders experienced capital appreciation of approximately 47.5% (share price from ~₹216.10 in April 2023 to ~₹417.70 in March 2024). The Board recommended a total dividend of ₹1.40 per share for FY24 (70% payout), compared to ₹1.20 per share in FY23.

### Segmental Performance

*   **Mechatronics and Aftermarket:** This segment reported revenue of ₹22,509 million in FY24, a 10% YoY growth from ₹20,610 million in FY23.

## Financial Analysis Report: Minda Corporation Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Key Accounting Policies

#### Auditor's Opinion

*   **Standalone Financial Statements:** S.R. Batliboi & Co. LLP issued an unqualified opinion, stating that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Consolidated Financial Statements:** S.R. Batliboi & Co. LLP issued an unqualified opinion, stating that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS and the Companies Act, 2013. The opinion relies on the reports of other auditors for 8 subsidiaries, 2 associates, and 1 joint venture, whose financial statements reflect total assets of ₹2,545 million and total revenues of ₹2,280 million.

#### Key Audit Matters (KAMs)

*   For both standalone and consolidated financial statements, the primary KAM identified was **Revenue recognition for sale of goods**. This was significant due to the variety of shipment terms impacting timing and the significant judgment and estimates involved in calculating price variations (volume-based discounts, price adjustments). Audit procedures included evaluating accounting policies against Ind AS 115, testing controls over revenue recognition timing and price variation calculations, testing sales transactions around year-end, and assessing the adequacy of disclosures.

#### Key Accounting Policies

*   **Basis of Preparation:** Financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis (except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments, and defined benefit liabilities measured at fair value) in accordance with Ind AS.
*   **Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):** Revenue is recognized when control of goods is transferred to the customer, measured at the consideration expected, adjusted for discounts, incentives, etc. A 5-step methodology is applied. Significant judgments include identifying distinct performance obligations, determining transaction price (fixed vs. variable, significant financing component), allocating transaction price, and determining if performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time.
*   **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives (e.g., Factory buildings: 30 years; Plant & Machinery: 5-15 years; Vehicles: 4 years). Useful lives are reviewed annually.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Other intangibles (software, brands) are amortized over their useful lives (typically 5 years).
*   **Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:** Assessed at each reporting date for indicators of impairment. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average basis) and net realizable value.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Classified and measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) based on business model and contractual cash flow characteristics. Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied for impairment of financial assets.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for leases. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed on a straight-line basis.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund) are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (Gratuity) are provided based on actuarial valuation using the Projected Unit Credit Method; remeasurements are recognized in OCI.
*   **Foreign Currency Transactions:** Translated at exchange rates prevailing on transaction dates. Monetary assets/liabilities are restated at year-end rates, with exchange differences generally recognized in profit or loss. For foreign operations, assets/liabilities are translated at year-end rates, income/expenses at transaction date rates/average rates, and translation differences to OCI.
*   **Business Combinations:** Accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill is the excess of consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired.
*   **Changes in Accounting Policies/New Standards:**
    *   Amendments to Ind AS 8 (Definition of Accounting Estimates), Ind AS 1 (Disclosure of Accounting Policies - material vs. significant), and Ind AS 12 (Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction) were applicable. The company stated these amendments did not have a material impact on the financial statements, though Ind AS 1 amendments impacted disclosures.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

#### Auditor's Report on Internal Financial Controls

*   **Standalone:** S.R. Batliboi & Co. LLP opined that the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024.
*   **Consolidated:** S.R. Batliboi & Co. LLP opined that the Group, its associates, and joint ventures (companies incorporated in India) have maintained, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024. This opinion relied on the reports of other auditors for 1 subsidiary, 1 associate, and 1 joint venture incorporated in India.

#### Audit Trail

*   **Standalone:** The Company used two accounting software. One had the audit trail (edit log) facility operational, though it was not enabled at the database level and for certain privileged access changes. The other software did not have the audit trail feature enabled due to technical limitations; the Company is planning to migrate this software. No instances of tampering were observed in the software where the feature was active.
*   **Consolidated:** Similar exceptions regarding audit trail enablement were noted for the Holding Company, some subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures. Specifically, for the Holding Company (one software), two subsidiaries, one associate, and one joint venture, the audit trail was not enabled for certain privileged access changes or at the database level. For the Holding Company (another software), one associate, and one joint venture, the feature was not present or operational throughout the year.

#### Management's Responsibility and Board's View

*   The Board's Report states that internal financial controls were in place, adequate, and operating effectively. The Audit Committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control framework. The Corporate Audit and Governance (CAG) team conducts internal audits.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **Companies Act, 2013 & SEBI Regulations:**
    *   The Directors' Responsibility Statement affirms compliance with applicable accounting standards, maintenance of adequate accounting records, preparation of accounts on a going concern basis, implementation of proper internal financial controls, and systems for compliance with applicable laws.

The BRSR also indicates NIL fines/penalties from regulators on NGRBC principles.
*   **Specific Compliances Noted:**
    *   Employee Stock Option Scheme 2017 implemented in accordance with SEBI Guidelines.
    *   Policy on Directors' Appointment and Remuneration is in place and disclosed.

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

*   **Contingent Liabilities:**
    *   **Income Tax:**
        *   Holding Company: Pertaining to AY 2016-17 to AY 2019-20, tax impact of ₹14 million related to disallowance of Sec 80IC deduction is pending with ITAT. Management is confident of a favorable outcome.
        *   Subsidiaries: Various matters including disallowance of R&D expenditure, transfer pricing adjustments, and professional expenses disallowance, with tax impacts totaling approximately ₹28 million (plus a ₹44 million underpayment assessment for an overseas subsidiary). The Group is appealing these and management believes outcomes will be favorable. A subsidiary also has a demand of ₹678 million regarding GST classification of finished goods, which is under appeal (₹68 million deposited under protest).
    *   **Sales Tax/VAT/GST:**
        *   Holding Company: Several matters pending with various authorities concerning differences in returns, disallowance/excess availment of ITC, and block credit issues, with a total disputed tax amount of approximately ₹79 million (excluding interest/penalties). The company believes it has fair chances of favorable decisions.
        *   Subsidiaries: Disputes related to non-submission of forms and ITC disallowance, with tax amounts involved.
    *   **Customs Duty:** A matter with ₹3 million tax impact is pending with Commissioner (Appeals).
    *   **International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Matter:** A settlement agreement requires the Company to pay ₹496 million (Euro 5.5 million) as per a Consent Award. The company has deposited this amount as per High Court order. The Company has an indemnity from a promoter entity and, based on legal opinion, believes there is no financial implication on the Company. This is a significant contingent liability effectively indemnified.

*   **Overall Assessment:** The company faces several tax-related litigations across direct and indirect taxes. While management expresses confidence in favorable outcomes for most, the aggregate disputed amounts are material. The ICC settlement, though indemnified, represents a substantial potential outflow if the indemnity is not honored.

### Related Party Transactions (RPTs)
