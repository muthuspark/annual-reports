## Financial Analysis Report: Sandhar Technologies Limited (STL)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

#### Standalone Financial Statements (FY 2023-24)

*   M/s. BSR & Co. LLP expressed an opinion that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Observations:**
    *   Backup of one accounting software was not kept on servers physically located in India on a daily basis from April 1, 2023, to May 5, 2023.
    *   Unable to comment on whether the audit trail feature was enabled and operated throughout the year at the database level for general ledger accounting software operated by a third-party service provider.
    *   The audit trail (edit log) facility for the general ledger accounting software was not enabled at the application level for part of the year (enabled from July 21, 2023).
    *   Unable to comment on whether the audit trail facility operated throughout the year for payroll accounting software operated by a third-party.
*   The Annexure A (CARO report) to the Standalone Auditor's Report did not contain qualifications concerning the Company's immovable properties not held in its name.

#### Consolidated Financial Statements (FY 2023-24)

*   M/s. BSR & Co. LLP opined that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view.
*   **Observations:**
    *   Similar observations regarding accounting software backup and audit trail functionalities as noted in the standalone report were made for the Holding Company and its Indian subsidiaries/joint ventures.
    *   The auditors relied on the reports of other auditors for eight subsidiaries and the Group's share in three joint ventures.
    *   Financial information for one subsidiary and three joint ventures was unaudited but deemed immaterial by management and auditors.
    *   The Annexure A (CARO report) to the Consolidated Auditor's Report mentioned unfavourable remarks, qualifications, or adverse remarks by respective auditors of Sandhar Technologies Limited (Holding Company - Clause 3(i)(c)), Sandhar Engineering Private Limited (Clause 3(xvii)), and Sandhar Auto Electric Solutions Private Limited (Clause 3(xvii)). CARO reports for certain other JVs/Subsidiaries were noted as not issued by their respective auditors as of the principal auditor's report date.

#### Analysis

While the auditors have provided an unqualified opinion on the "true and fair view" of both standalone and consolidated financial statements, significant internal control weaknesses pertaining to IT General Controls (ITGCs) specifically around accounting software backups and audit trail functionalities have been highlighted. These control deficiencies, while not altering the overall fairness of the reported financials for FY24, pose risks to data integrity and reliability if not remediated. The reliance on other auditors and unaudited components (though immaterial) in the consolidated accounts is a standard disclosure. The CARO qualifications by other auditors on specific entities within the group warrant attention to the specific issues raised in those individual reports.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   The standalone and consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).

#### Change in Disclosure Policy

*   Effective April 1, 2023, the Company adopted "Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendment to Ind AS 1)". This amendment requires the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies and provides guidance on the application of materiality.

#### Key Material Accounting Policies

*   **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when control is transferred, based on contract terms (point in time). This is identified as a Key Audit Matter due to its significance and potential pressure to meet expectations.
*   **Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):** Measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Useful lives are generally aligned with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, with some exceptions (e.g., temporary erections, specific computer hardware, non-commercial vehicles) where management estimates shorter lives based on technical assessments.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Technical know-how is amortized over 60-72 months; software over 4-5 years. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
