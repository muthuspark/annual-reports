*   **Regulatory Risk:** The penalty imposed by BSE and NSE in the previous financial year is the only instance of a possible violation. The regulatory risk appears moderate, mainly associated with ongoing legal proceedings and the potential impact of those proceedings. The Company's compliance with listing regulations and timely filing of reports suggest a proactive approach to regulatory matters. The pending resolution of the land dispute, and adherence to regulations like Companies Act 2013, SEBI Listing Regulations adds a layer of risk.
