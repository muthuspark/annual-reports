## Cash Management: A Deep Dive into Cash Flow and Liquidity Analysis

### Cash Flow Analysis (Standalone vs. Consolidated)

All figures are in ₹ Lacs.

#### Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

##### Standalone OCF:

*   FY24: ₹(22,094.94) (Net Cash Flow from/(used in) Operating Activities)
*   FY23: ₹(35,038.85)

**Analysis:** Standalone OCF remained negative in FY24 but showed improvement (lesser outflow) compared to FY23. The negative OCF is primarily driven by significant working capital changes, particularly increases in 'Bank Balance other than cash & cash equivalents' (₹57,650.80 outflow in FY24) and 'Loans for margin trading' (₹7,046.20 outflow in FY24), offset by increases in 'Trade Payables' (₹4,096.58 inflow) and 'Other financial liabilities' (₹6,042.71 inflow). Profit before tax was ₹39,954.26 in FY24.

##### Consolidated OCF:

*   FY24: ₹(31,043.33)
*   FY23: ₹(16,829.22)

**Analysis:** Consolidated OCF worsened in FY24, with a larger net cash outflow from operations. This was despite a higher Profit Before Tax of ₹55,697.56. Key working capital changes include outflows for 'Bank Balance other than cash & cash equivalents' (₹59,904.16) and 'Loans' (₹18,028.60), partially offset by inflows from 'Trade Payables' (₹987.48) and 'Other financial liabilities' (₹5,950.45). The increase in loan disbursements by the NBFC subsidiary likely contributed to this outflow.

#### Investing Cash Flow (ICF)

##### Standalone ICF:

*   FY24: ₹(4,081.45) (Net Cash Flow from/(used in) Investing Activities)
*   FY23: ₹(30.11)

**Key Components FY24:** Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment ₹(1,481.94); Purchase of investments ₹(34,364.57); Disposal of investments ₹31,765.06.

**Analysis:** Significantly higher net cash outflow in FY24 primarily due to increased net investment activity compared to FY23.

##### Consolidated ICF:

*   FY24: ₹(4,914.79)
*   FY23: ₹(1,000.97)

**Key Components FY24:** Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment ₹(1,931.87); Purchase of Intangibles and Assets under development ₹(56.90); Purchase of investments ₹(35,135.36); Disposal of investments ₹31,896.26.

**Analysis:** Consolidated ICF also saw a larger outflow in FY24, driven by net investments and higher capex on PPE compared to FY23.

#### Financing Cash Flow (FCF)

##### Standalone FCF:

*   FY24: ₹30,702.84 (Net Cash Flow from/(used in) Financing activities)
*   FY23: ₹28,892.46

**Key Components FY24:** Proceeds from issue of Equity shares (from warrant conversion) ₹29,521.77; Increase in borrowings ₹10,763.08; Dividend Paid ₹(4,510.62); Finance cost paid ₹(5,071.39).

**Analysis:** Positive FCF in both years, largely due to proceeds from warrant conversions and increased borrowings, partially offset by dividend payments and finance costs

## Financial Analysis Report: Share India Securities Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Overall Financial Performance & Position

Share India Securities Limited (SISL) reported robust financial performance for FY 2023-24. Consolidated revenue from operations increased by 36.26% YoY to ₹1,48,281.45 Lacs, and consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) grew by 28.76% YoY to ₹42,575.88 Lacs. Standalone revenue from operations saw a 36.49% YoY increase to ₹1,11,901.11 Lacs, with PAT rising by 32.05% YoY to ₹30,099.18 Lacs.

Key financial ratios show a decline in Return on Net Worth (RoNW) to 30.64% in FY24 from 44.79% in FY23 (Consolidated). This is attributed to equity expansion from rights issues, warrant conversions, and ESOP allotments. The Debt Equity Ratio remains low at 0.06 times (Consolidated FY24).

### Risk Analysis

#### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Trend:** Increasing due to dynamic market and technological landscape.

**Analysis:**

*   **Competition:** The financial services and broking industry is highly competitive, with pressure from traditional players and agile fintech startups. SISL's strategy to be a "go-to fintech company" implies significant competitive pressure.
*   **Technological Disruption:** The company identifies as "technology-driven" and has invested in uTrade Solutions and Algowire. The risk lies in the ability to continually innovate, integrate acquisitions effectively (e.g., proposed Silverleaf Capital Services amalgamation), and adapt to new technologies like AI faster than competitors. Failure to do so could impact market share and relevance.
*   **Market Expansion (Retail & International):** Strategies for deeper retail penetration ("Har Ghar Algo") and international expansion (GIFT City, Singapore) present execution risks, cultural adaptation challenges, and exposure to new regulatory environments.
*   **Product Diversification:** Expansion into NBFC, insurance broking, merchant banking, and wealth management diversifies revenue but also introduces risks associated with managing varied business lines and their specific market dynamics.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Continuous investment in technology (AI-based platforms, uTrade solutions for back-testing and retail algos).
*   Strategic acquisitions (Algowire, uTrade, proposed Silverleaf) to enhance tech capabilities and market presence.
*   Focus on customer-centric models and innovative product development.
*   Leveraging GIFT City IFSC and Singapore subsidiary for international growth.
*   Building a strong brand based on "differentiation and trust."

**Control Effectiveness:** The company's consistent PAT CAGR (76% over 7 years, though this specific figure is for standalone PAT) and revenue growth suggest effective strategy execution to date. The Board's composition is stated to support strategic initiatives.

**Potential Financial Impact:** Failure to execute strategically could lead to market share erosion, reduced profitability, and slower growth than projected. Successful execution can lead to sustained high growth and increased shareholder value.

#### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium to High
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Trend:** Increasing with scale, technological complexity, and international operations.

**Analysis:**

*   **System Latency & Reliability:** As a technology-driven institution focusing on latency-based, high-tech trading solutions, system performance and uptime are critical. Any significant downtime or latency issues could lead to financial losses and reputational damage.
*   **Algorithmic Trading Execution:** Reliance on algorithmic trading platforms (uTrade Algos, Algowire) means any flaws in algorithms, back-testing, or execution engines could lead to significant trading losses.
*   **Cybersecurity:** With increasing digitization and online platforms (IBT for retail), the risk of cyber-attacks, data breaches, and system vulnerabilities is significant. The BRSR identifies "Data Security & Customer Privacy" as a risk.
*   **Human Capital & Talent Management:** Expansion and technological advancements require skilled personnel. Attracting, training, and retaining talent in a competitive market is crucial. The BRSR lists "Human Capital and Talent Management" as an opportunity, implying it's also a risk if not managed well. Employee turnover rate for permanent employees in FY24 was 37.08%.
*   **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery:** Dependence on technology necessitates robust BCP and DR plans (referenced as "DR Site" under strengths).
*   **Integration of Acquisitions:** Integrating new entities like uTrade, Algowire, and potentially Silverleaf presents operational challenges in aligning systems, processes, and culture.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   State-of-the-art risk management systems using decentralized tech, AI, Stress Test, Kill Switch, DR Site.
*   Focus on low latency trading platforms.
*   Internal controls and internal audit function reporting to the Audit Committee.
*   Employee training programs (though BRSR indicates 0% of KMPs and Board received training on "Nature of Industry, Role and Responsibility, Business Model" in FY24, which seems contradictory to familiarization programs mentioned elsewhere).
*   Policies on cyber security and data privacy.

**Control Effectiveness:** The company highlights "Deep tech expertise" and "Superior technology competence" as strengths. The internal audit function and Audit Committee oversight are in place. The Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Financial Controls (Standalone & Consolidated) expressed an unmodified opinion on adequacy and operating effectiveness.

**Potential Financial Impact:** Operational failures could lead to direct financial losses, client compensation, regulatory penalties, and severe reputational damage impacting client trust and acquisition.

#### Financial Risks

*   **Severity:** High
*   **Likelihood:** High (inherent in the industry)
*   **Trend:** Stable to Increasing, given market volatility and business expansion.

**Analysis:**

*   **Market Volatility:** The company's revenues, particularly from broking and proprietary trading, are directly exposed to stock market volatility, which can impact trading volumes and the value of securities held. The MD&A notes the market's resilience but also acknowledges inherent volatility.
*   **Credit Risk:**
    *   NBFC Operations: The ₹260+ Crore NBFC loan book (Share India Fincap) carries credit risk.
    *   Client Funding: Providing margin funding to clients in the broking business exposes the company to default risk if clients cannot meet margin calls.
*   **Liquidity Risk:** Ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs, margin requirements, and client settlements is crucial, especially during volatile market conditions.
*   **Interest Rate Risk:** Changes in interest rates can affect the profitability of NBFC operations and the cost of borrowings.
*   **Currency Risk:** Expansion into international markets (Singapore subsidiary, IFSC operations) and proprietary positions in currency derivatives expose the company to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The BRSR states foreign exchange risk of proprietary positions is managed by hedging.
*   **Capital Adequacy:** Maintaining adequate capital to support business growth, meet regulatory requirements, and absorb potential losses. The recent rights issue and warrant conversions aimed to strengthen the capital base.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Robust risk management systems for trading activities.
*   Hedging foreign currency exposures for proprietary positions.
*   Collecting upfront margins from customers and monitoring positions (Mark-to-Market).
*   Diversified product portfolio to reduce reliance on a single revenue stream.
*   Strong net worth (Consolidated: ₹17,471.76 Lacs as of March 31, 2024) and access to capital pool.
*   Prudent asset-liability management.
*   Credit ratings obtained (e.g., ACUITE A+/A1+, Infomerics IVR A1+) for bank facilities and commercial paper.

**Control Effectiveness:** The company emphasizes its "robust capital pool" and "state-of-the-art risk management system." The Risk Management Committee oversees these aspects. The low Debt-Equity ratio (0.06) indicates a conservative leverage position.

**Potential Financial Impact:** Adverse market movements can significantly impact trading income and investment values. Credit defaults can lead to write-offs. Liquidity crunches can impair operational capability.

#### Compliance/Regulatory Risks

*   **Severity:** High
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Trend:** Increasing due to evolving regulatory landscape and international operations.

**Analysis:**

*   The financial services industry is heavily regulated by SEBI, RBI, Stock Exchanges, etc. Non-compliance can lead to penalties, reputational damage, and license revocation.
*   The MD&A notes that "Regulations set by SEBI govern the operations... Changes in regulations can affect brokerage business models and profitability."
*   Specific areas include SEBI (LODR), Insider Trading regulations, KYC/AML norms, data privacy laws, and regulations specific to NBFCs, insurance broking, and international jurisdictions (Singapore, IFSC).
*   The company has a Code of Conduct

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The Statutory Auditors, M/s. SVP & Associates, Chartered Accountants, issued an unmodified opinion on the standalone and consolidated financial statements of Share India Securities Limited for the financial year ended March 31, 2024. The audit reports state that the financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. No qualifications, adverse remarks, or disclaimers were made in either the standalone or consolidated auditor's reports.

The consolidated financial statements include audited financial statements of nine subsidiaries and unaudited financial statements of one subsidiary. The auditor's opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries audited by other auditors, is based solely on the reports of such other auditors. The unaudited subsidiary was deemed not material to the Group.

### Key Accounting Policies

Share India Securities Limited has prepared its financial statements in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS). Key accounting policies include:

*   **Basis of Preparation:** Financial statements are prepared on an accrual and historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, securities held for trading, share-based payments, derivative financial instruments, and defined benefit plans, which are measured at fair value or as per actuarial valuation.
*   **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized based on a five-step model under Ind AS 115. Brokerage income is recognized on a trade date basis. Interest income is recognized on a time proportion basis. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established. Proprietary trading income is recognized as per Ind AS 109 when the trade is executed.
*   **Financial Instruments (Ind AS 109):** Financial assets are classified at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVPL). Financial liabilities are generally measured at amortized cost, except for derivatives and those designated at FVPL. Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are recognized for financial assets not at FVPL.
*   **Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the diminishing balance method over estimated useful lives prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 (one subsidiary uses SLM).
*   **Intangible Assets:** Measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Software is typically amortized over 3-5 years, and other intangibles over 5-10 years using the diminishing balance method (two subsidiaries use SLM for depreciation/amortization). Intangible assets under development are capitalized if criteria are met.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized for leases. ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed on a straight-line basis.
*   **Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:** Assessed at each reporting date for indicators of impairment.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Short-term benefits are recognized as an expense. Defined contribution plan contributions are charged to profit or loss. Defined benefit plans (gratuity) are accounted for using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial gains/losses recognized in OCI.
*   **Share-Based Payments (Ind AS 102):** Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value on the grant date and expensed over the vesting period.
*   **Consolidation (for Consolidated Financial Statements):** Subsidiaries are fully consolidated. Associates are accounted for using the equity method. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated. Non-controlling interests are presented separately.

No significant changes in accounting policies were highlighted for the financial year 2023-24. The company has complied with applicable Ind AS standards issued and effective as of March 31, 2024.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

The Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Financial Controls under Section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, for both standalone and consolidated financial statements, states that the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial control system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024. This opinion is based on the audit conducted in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI. For consolidated statements, this opinion also considers the reports of other auditors for subsidiary companies incorporated in India.

The Board's Report and Management Discussion & Analysis also affirm the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control systems, stating they are commensurate with its size, scale, and complexity. The Audit Committee actively reviews these systems.

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

As per the Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements (Note 41) and Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 43):

*   **Guarantees:**
    *   The Company has given corporate guarantees for financial assistance taken by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Share India Algoplus Private Limited, amounting to ₹19,800 Lacs (Standalone) as of March 31, 2024.
    *   Bank guarantees have been provided aggregating to ₹1,52,775.00 Lacs (Standalone) and ₹1,59,722.00 Lacs (Consolidated) for meeting margin requirements and security deposits with various exchanges (NSE Clearing, BSE, ICCL, MCX Clearing, NCCL). These are secured by pledged fixed deposits and properties.
*   **Income Tax Matters:**
    *   Standalone: Outstanding demands include ₹9.14 Lacs (AY 2008-09), ₹2.68 Lacs (AY 2015-16), and ₹78.41 Lacs (AY 2013-14, appeal filed with CIT(Appeals) and pending).
    *   Consolidated: In addition to the above, demands include ₹16.78 Lacs (AY 2017-18, appeal filed with CIT(Appeals)), ₹36.10 Lacs (AY 2021-22), and ₹4.76 Lacs (AY 2022-23 & 2018-19).
    *   The Company/Group is contesting these demands and believes its position will likely be upheld, hence no provision has been accrued. Management believes the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect.
*   No other significant and material orders passed by Regulators or Courts impacting the going concern status and future operations were reported.

The potential impact of these income tax matters, if adverse, could lead to cash outflows. However, management's assessment is that no material adverse effect is expected. The guarantees represent contingent liabilities that would crystallize if the primary obligors default.
