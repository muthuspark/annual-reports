### Key Observations

*   Consistent Growth: Gravita has demonstrated consistent growth in revenue, EBITDA, and PAT over the past three years.
*   Improving Profitability: Both EBITDA and PAT margins have shown improvements, indicating effective cost control and operational efficiency.
*   Strong Financial Position: The significant reduction in the Debt:Equity ratio points to a strengthening balance sheet and reduced financial risk.
*   High Returns: ROE and ROCE remain at very healthy levels, although there's a slight dip in FY24, likely due to investments in growth.

### Business Segment Performance

*   **Lead Recycling:** This remains Gravita's core business, with a significant production capacity of 236,559 MT. The global lead market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% (2024-2033), driven primarily by the battery industry. Gravita is well-positioned to benefit from this, especially with the rise of renewable energy storage systems, which use lead-acid batteries. The Company has successfully empanelled on MCX as a refiner.
*   **Aluminium Recycling:** Gravita has a capacity of 30,000 MT. The global secondary aluminum market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8%, driven by demand in the automotive, construction, and packaging industries. India's per capita aluminum consumption is below the global average, offering significant growth potential.
*   **Plastic Recycling:** Gravita's capacity is 24,300 MT. While the plastic recycling industry faces challenges, regulatory pressure and consumer demand for sustainable solutions are driving growth. Gravita's focus on advanced technologies like chemical recycling positions it well.
*   **Rubber Recycling:** This is a relatively new vertical for Gravita (added in 2022), indicating diversification. The production capacity for captive consumption stands at 12,000 MT.

The report emphasizes value-added products contributing 45% of revenue. This strategy is crucial for margin improvement and differentiation.

### Major Strategic Initiatives and Their Progress

*   Expansion of Recycling Capacity: Gravita has been actively expanding its capacity across multiple locations (Tanzania, Togo, Mundra, Chittoor). This expansion is both geographic (new facilities in Africa and the Middle East) and vertical (adding rubber recycling).
*   Diversification of Recycling Verticals: The 'Vision 2028' outlines plans to enter new recycling verticals: Lithium, Steel, and Paper. This diversification reduces reliance on any single material and taps into growing markets.
*   Value-Added Products: The focus on increasing the share of revenue from value-added products (customized alloys, lead sheets, plastic granules, etc.) is a key strategy for margin improvement.
*   Turnkey Solutions: Providing turnkey recycling plant solutions to clients globally is a unique offering that leverages Gravita's in-house technology and expertise.
*   Technology Upgradation: Investments in advanced technologies (electric refining furnace, oxygen trials in smelting) aim to improve efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and lower costs.
*   Hedging: The company utilizes a back-to-back hedging mechanism, selling the metal equivalent of purchased scrap, to mitigate the risk of commodity price fluctuations.
*   SAP implementation: SAP was installed as an ERP system to improve and streamline operations.

### Risk Landscape Changes

*   Geopolitical Risks: The report acknowledges increased risks associated with global expansion, including regulatory challenges, import/export limitations, and overlapping tax systems. The ongoing war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East are specifically mentioned as disruptors.
*   Commodity Price Volatility: The company effectively manages this through hedging, but it remains a key risk factor.
*   Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Exposure to fluctuations in the Indian Rupee against major foreign currencies (primarily USD) is a constant risk, mitigated through forex management and hedging.
*   Competition: The lead and lead products markets are described as highly competitive, requiring continuous operational efficiency and innovation.
*   Sustainability Risk (ESG): This is increasingly important, with stricter regulations and growing stakeholder expectations.
*   Technology Risk: The company acknowledges continuous efforts to enhance efficiency through implementation of range of measures.

### ESG Initiatives and Metrics

*   **Environmental:**
    *   Focus on the circular economy model, minimizing resource use and waste.
    *   Investments in renewable energy (solar power: 1.68 MU of solar power generated, abating 1,192 tonnes of CO2 emissions).
    *   Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (1,193 TCO2e).
    *   Water management initiatives, including recycling and rainwater harvesting (water usage intensity of 0.43 KL/MT).
    *   Pilot project for electric refining furnace.
    *   ISO 14001:2015 certified Environmental Management System.
    *   Vision 2028 targets include increased renewable energy usage (30%+) and reduced energy consumption (10%+).

*   **Social:**
    *   Commitment to employee well-being and development (3,350+ employees, average training hours).
    *   CSR initiatives focused on education, healthcare, and environmental preservation (₹1.49 Crores spent).
    *   Emphasis on diversity and inclusion (celebration of Women's Day, increased female workforce participation).
    *   Prevention of child labor policy.

*   **Governance:**
    *   Adherence to corporate governance standards, with a focus on transparency and ethical conduct.
    *   Independent board of directors.
    *   Robust internal controls and risk management frameworks.
    *   Stable credit rating from ICRA.

### Management Outlook

The management outlook is optimistic, reflected in the "Vision 2028" goals:

*   Establishment of new recycling verticals.
*   Significant volume and profitability growth (25%+ CAGR and 35%+ growth, respectively).
*   Increased use of renewable energy and reduced energy consumption.
*   Attainment of a portfolio mix with a higher proportion of value-added products (50%+) and a reduced reliance on lead (30%+ non-lead business).
*   Strong ROCE target (25%+).
*   Continued focus on circular economy, and transformation into one of the top 5 global recycling companies by 2026.

### Comparative Analysis with Industry Averages

*   **Growth Rates:** Gravita's revenue and profit growth rates generally exceed the projected growth rates for the global lead and aluminum recycling markets, indicating a strong competitive position.
*   **ROE/ROCE:** Gravita's ROE and ROCE are significantly higher than typical industry averages, demonstrating superior returns on invested capital.
*   **Debt-to-Equity:** Gravita's improving debt-to-equity ratio suggests a stronger financial position compared to highly leveraged companies in the sector.
*   **ESG Metrics:** Gravita's commitment to renewable energy, water conservation, and waste reduction, along with its certifications, suggest a strong ESG profile.

### Overall Assessment

Gravita India Ltd. presents a strong performance overview with consistent growth, improving profitability, and a strengthening financial position. The company's strategic initiatives, particularly its focus on diversification, value-added products, and ESG, position it well for future success. The management's outlook is optimistic, supported by ambitious but achievable goals. However, external factors like geopolitical risks and commodity price volatility need continued monitoring and mitigation.

| **Net Cash from Operating Activities (A)**                       | **67.70**      | **216.86**     |

##### Key Observations (OCF):

*   **Decreased OCF:**  OCF decreased significantly from Rs. 216.86 crores in FY23 to Rs. 67.70 crores in FY24. The Largest reason for this drop is increased cash outflow for working capital and investments.
*   **Working Capital Impact:**  The major driver of the OCF decrease is the significant *increase* in inventories and other assets. This means Gravita is tying up more cash in its working capital cycle. This negative impact needs to be considered.

##### Key Observations (ICF):

*   **Increased Capital Expenditure:** Gravita significantly increased its capital expenditure, indicating investment in growth and expansion.

#### Financing Cash Flow (FCF) - Consolidated

| Component                              | FY 2023-24 (Cr) | FY 2022-23 (Cr) |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |

| Dividends Paid                         | (30.03)        | (13.78)        |
| **Net Cash from/(used in) Financing Activities (C)** | **47.32**   | **(42.99)**   |

##### Key Observations (FCF):

*   **Net Cash inflow from financing:** Gravita used FCF for repayment of debt, payment of lease liabilites and dividend to its shareholders.

#### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation

*   **Approximate FCF = OCF + ICF**
*   **FY24 FCF:** 67.70 - 120.19 = **-52.49 Cr.**
*   **FY23 FCF:** 216.86 -75.49 = **141.37 Cr.**

##### Key Takeaway:
Gravita had a negative free cash flow in FY24, driven by increased investment and working capital needs. This means it required external financing (or existing cash reserves) to fund its operations and investments.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Debtors Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY24: 5.85 times
    *   FY23: 8.11 times
    *   Change: (27.92%) decrease
    *   **Interpretation:** The decrease indicates a *slower* collection of receivables, which is *negative* for working capital efficiency.
* **Inventory turnover days**

|                                | FY23       | FY24   |
| :----------------------------- | :--------- | :----- |
| Cost of material consumed  | 1,700.66   | 2,159.60   |
| Purchases of stock-in-trade    | 363.45     | 733.96 |
| Changes in inventories     | (126.25)   | 61.88  |
| Average inventory |575.60      | 777.10 |
| **Inventory Turnover Ratio**                  |3.60 |3.84|
|**Inventory Turnover Days**|101.41|95.02|

*   **Creditors Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY24: 5.87 times
    *   FY23: 9.97 times
    *   Change: (41.18%) decrease
    *   **Interpretation:** The decrease indicates a *faster* payment of payable, which is *negative* for working capital efficiency.
* **Creditors Turnover Days**

* **FY24** = 365/5.87 = 62.18 days
* **FY23**= 365/9.97= 36.61 days
    **Interpretation:** The increase in days indicate the payment of payables is slow, which is *positive* for working capital management.

*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**
    *   CCC = Inventory Days + Receivable Days - Payable Days
    *   **FY24 CCC** = 95.02 + 62.22 - 62.18= 95.06
     * **FY23 CCC** = 101.41+44.99 - 36.61= 109.80
    *   **Interpretation:** The CCC improved slightly, due to major contribution of increased inventory turnover ratio, showing improved working capital management. However, other factors (lower debtor turnover, and faster creditor payments) worked against this.

#### Overall Working Capital Assessment:

Gravita's working capital management shows mixed signals. While the increased inventory indicates that they are not efficiently managing their inventory. The reduced debtor turnover and increased creditor turnover indicates that the company may face working capital crunch. The company is managing its payable better but they need to improve its collection policy for trade receivables.

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividends:**
    *   FY23: Final dividend of Rs. 4.35 per share (Rs. 30.03 crores total) was declared and paid.
    *   FY24: Interim dividend of Rs. 5.20 per share (Rs. 35.90 crores) was declared but no final dividend for FY24 was recommended.
    *   **Trend:** There is payment of dividend however, no final dividend has been declared for FY24.
*   **Share Buybacks:** The report states that no shares have been bought back in the last five years.

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

*   FY24 (Standalone): 3.61
*   FY23 (Standalone): 7.73
*   Change: (53.28%) decrease

#### Approximate Consolidated DSCR:

*   **Numerator:**
    *   FY24: 238.98 + 37.51 + 48.77 = 325.26
    *   FY23: 201.15 + 23.96 + 41.68 = 266.79
*   **Denominator:**
     * FY 24:48.77+2.32+198.28= 249.37
     * FY23: 41.68+2.73+46.25 = 90.66
*   **Approximate Consolidated DSCR:**
    *   FY24: 325.26/249.37= **1.30**
    *   FY23: 266.79/90.66 = **2.94**

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Liquidity Position:**
    *   **Current Ratio (Standalone):**
        *   FY24: 1.34
        *   FY23: 1.35
    *   **Cash and Cash Equivalents (Consolidated):**
        *   FY24: Rs. 57.13 crores
        *   FY23: Rs. 42.20 crores
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**
    * As discussed earlier the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) is 95.06 and 109.80 for FY24 and FY23 respectively.

### Free Cash Flow Yield Trends

*   FY24 FCF: -52.49 Cr. (Negative)
*   FY23 FCF: 141.37 Cr. (Positive)

### Overall Assessment and Additional Points

*   **Profitability:** Gravita has shown consistent profitability, with increases in revenue, EBITDA, and net profit. However, the margin improvements are relatively small.
*   **Growth vs. Cash Flow:** The company is clearly in a growth phase, with significant investments in capacity expansion. However, this growth is currently consuming cash, resulting in negative free cash flow. This isn't necessarily bad, but it increases reliance on external financing and makes the company more sensitive to interest rate changes and economic downturns.
*   **Debt Levels:** While the debt-to-equity ratio improved on a standalone basis, a consolidated perspective is important. The absolute level of debt has increased, and the DSCR has decreased.
*   **Working Capital:** The mixed signals in working capital management (slower collections, faster supplier payments, but slightly improved CCC) warrant further scrutiny.
* **Transparency:** The report from Gravita India LTD. lacks many figures and tables needed for a thorough analysis.

### Overall Analysis and Key Observations

*   **Decreasing Profitability Ratios:** ROE, ROA are decreasing, showing a decline, and indicating a decline in how efficiently the Group uses its equity, assets, and capital to generate profit.
*    **Decline in Liquidity:** The Current Ratio decrease is a point of focus. The Group has less current asset coverage of its short-term liabilities. While still above 1, this trend needs to be monitored.
*  **Improving Leverage:** The Debt-to-Equity ratio has improved significantly, indicating the Group is reducing its reliance on debt financing. This is generally a positive sign for financial stability.
*    **Decreasing Efficiency:** Both the total asset turnover ratio and the fixed asset turnover ratio are decreasing, this needs to be addressed.

#### Significant Deviations and Concerns

*   The lack of granular data (e.g., Cost of Goods Sold, detailed inventory breakdowns, breakdown of current assets and current liabilities, and segment-wise capital employed) limits the depth of this analysis.
*    The decreasing profitability and efficiency ratios are a point of focus, and may need to be further investigated.

#### Further Steps

To get a complete picture, the following would be needed:

1.  **Full Consolidated Financial Statements:** Including all notes and disclosures, for multiple years (at least 3-5) to establish clear trends.
2.  **Industry Average Data:** Access to relevant industry average ratios (from reliable financial databases) to benchmark Gravita's performance.
3.  **Segment-Level Data:** Detailed segment financials to calculate ROIC and better understand segment-specific performance drivers.
4.  **Management Commentary:** The "Management Discussion and Analysis" section of the full Annual Report would provide valuable context.
5. **Additional Data** for Calculations such as Inventory and Receivables.

This analysis provides a preliminary assessment based on the available information. A more comprehensive review would be possible with complete data.

## Audit and Regulatory Analysis of Gravita India Ltd.

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   **Opinion:** Qualified Opinion.
*   **Qualification:** Walker Chandiok & Co LLP issued a *qualified opinion* on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements.
*   **Reason for Qualification:**  The qualification relates to the accounting treatment of employee benefit expenses related to the sale of treasury shares held by the Gravita Employee Welfare Trust under the terminated Gravita Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme, 2017 (the "Scheme"). The auditors believe the gain on the sale of these shares should be recognized under Other Equity and that the benefits to be provided to employees should be accounted for as employee benefit expenses, in accordance with Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 102. The company directly debited 'Other Equity'.
*   **Impact of Qualification:** Had the company followed the auditor's recommended treatment, employee benefit expenses would have been Rs. 20.67 crores higher, and profit before tax and total comprehensive income would have been Rs. 20.67 crores lower for FY 2023-24. There would be no net impact on Other Equity.
*   Cost Audit Report was filed during the review period and there were no qualifications.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*The company's main accounting policies:*

*   Revenue Recognition: Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the buyer, net of returns and rebates.
*   Inventories: Valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the moving weighted average method.
*   Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E): Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
*   Financial Instruments: Initially measured at fair value (adjusted for transaction costs, except for those at FVTPL). Subsequent measurement depends on the classification (amortized cost or fair value).
*   Impairment of Non-Financial Assets: Assessed at each balance sheet date. If indicators of impairment exist, the recoverable amount is estimated.
*   Foreign currency translation: Hyperinflationary economies, all amounts (i.e. assets, liabilities, equity items, income and expenses) of foreign operation, whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, are translated into INR at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and the comparative figures shall be those that were presented as current year amounts in the relevant prior year financial statement.
*   Employee Benefits: Defined contribution plans (e.g., provident fund) are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (e.g., gratuity) are measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
*   Leases: Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease.
*   Hedge accounting: For hedging of highly probable forecasted transactions.

*Change in accounting policy:*
The Group's subsidiary operating in Ghana considered inflation rate and restated it's statements as per Ind AS 29.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   **Auditor's Opinion:** The auditors issued a *modified opinion* on the internal financial controls with reference to the financial statements.
*   **Material Weakness Identified:** A material weakness was identified related to the accounting treatment of the employee benefit expenses and sale of treasury shares related to the terminated Scheme, as described above. The auditors stated that internal financial controls over this area were *not operating effectively*.
*   **Internal Audit System:** The Company has an in-house Internal Audit department and engages external firm KPMG for internal audits. The Audit Committee reviews reports from both.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **General Compliance:** The company generally complied with applicable statutory provisions and Secretarial Standards (SS-1 and SS-2).
*   **Listing Regulations:** The company complied with the corporate governance requirements of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
*   **Insider Trading:** The company has a policy for prohibition of Insider Trading.
*   **Whistleblower Policy:** A Whistle Blower Policy/Vigil Mechanism is in place.
*   **SEBI Fine:** Fine paid in previous year. The company did have some delays in the past year of 2022-2023 for submissions that were required by Regulation 23(9) and 30.

### Legal Proceedings and Their Potential Impact

*   **Contingent Liabilities:** The company disclosed contingent liabilities related to bank guarantees and claims not acknowledged as debts (primarily tax-related: Excise Duty, Customs Duty, Service Tax, and Goods and Services Tax).
*   **Customs Duty Demand:** A significant issue is a demand order from the Office of the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive), Jodhpur, for Rs. 70.10 crores (excluding interest, fine, and penalty). The company is contesting this order, believing it has a strong case based on legal and tax opinions. Management does not expect a material impact on the financial statements.

### Related Party Transactions

*   **Transactions:** The company entered into related party transactions that were conducted on an arm's length basis and in the ordinary course of business. There were no materially significant transactions that raised conflict of interest concerns.
*   **Disclosure:** Related party transactions and balances are disclosed in Note 45 (Standalone) and Note 47 (Consolidated).

*   **No other material changes** have been disclosed by the company which can effect the position of the company.

### Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality Concerns:** The qualified audit opinion and the identified material weakness in internal controls raise significant concerns about the quality of accounting practices, particularly regarding the treatment of employee benefits and share-based payments. This suggests a need for the company to strengthen its internal controls and potentially review its accounting policies and procedures.
*   **Regulatory Risk:**
    *   *High:* The ongoing dispute with the customs authorities represents a substantial regulatory risk. An adverse outcome could have a material financial impact, although management believes the risk is low.
    *   *Moderate:* Past delays in regulatory filings, though seemingly resolved, indicate a potential area for improvement in compliance processes.
    *   *Low:* The company generally appears to be compliant with most regulations, but the internal control weakness related to accounting for employee benefits raises a compliance risk.
    The internal financial controls are weak, showing that improvements can be made to the structure, policies and procedures, etc.
