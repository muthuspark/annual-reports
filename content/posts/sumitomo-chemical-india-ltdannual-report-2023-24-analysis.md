*   The auditor's report highlights a matter related to the accounting software's audit trail feature, noting that it is not enabled for certain changes made using privileged/administrative access rights, for the Holding Company and its subsidiary.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
*   Accounting policies have been consistently applied, except for changes resulting from the adoption of new or amended Ind AS standards, effective April 1, 2023:

*   The changes had no impact on the measurement, recognition, or presentation in the standalone reports, except for the changes caused by the application of the amendments of Ind AS 1. The changes in the consolidated report were the impact in disclosures and presentation.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   The auditor's report expresses an unmodified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Group's internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to the consolidated and standalone Ind AS financial statements, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria.
*   Management represents maintaining adequate accounting records, safeguarding assets, and preventing/detecting fraud.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   The Company is challenging a 2022 Central Government Notification restricting Glyphosate use to Pest Control Operators.
*   The Company does not expect these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on the financial statements.

### Related Party Transactions

*   All related party transactions during the financial year were on an arm's length basis.
*   The Company has disclosed transactions with Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited, Japan (the Holding Company), which are considered 'material transactions' under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

*   Except for the proposed final dividend, there are no other significant events after the reporting period that require adjustments or disclosures in the financial statements.

## Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The adoption of Ind AS, regular review of estimates, and the independent audit with an unmodified opinion suggest a high quality of financial reporting. However, the noted exception regarding the audit trail feature in the accounting software indicates a potential area for improvement in internal controls.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The Company faces regulatory risks, particularly in relation to product regulations (e.g., the Glyphosate Notification). The ongoing litigations highlight this risk, although management does not anticipate a material adverse impact. The Company's compliance with various regulations and prompt payment of statutory dues, with minor exceptions, demonstrate generally sound regulatory risk management. The reliance on China for raw materials and intermediates is also noted as a cause for concern in the Management Discussion and Analysis.
