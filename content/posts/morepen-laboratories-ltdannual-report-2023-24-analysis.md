#### Standalone Financial Statements

The Statutory Auditors, M/s. S. P. Babuta & Associates, issued an **unmodified opinion**, stating that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs as at March 31, 2024, and of the profit, total comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India.

*   **Key Audit Matter (Standalone):** The auditors highlighted the Scheme of Arrangement & Compromise related to the allotment of equity shares to Fixed Deposit (FD) holders and the subsequent NCLT/NCLAT orders regarding the cancellation of certain shares and payment of outstanding dues. This matter involves the ongoing process of paying FD dues for shares received for cancellation. The auditor's response involved collecting and analyzing relevant legal orders and communications.

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

The Statutory Auditors, M/s. S. P. Babuta & Associates, issued an **unmodified opinion**, stating that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, profit, total comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows.

*   **Key Audit Matter (Consolidated):** Similar to the standalone report, the auditors highlighted the Scheme of Arrangement involving FD holders and share cancellations as a Key Audit Matter.
*   **Other Matters (Consolidated):** The auditors did not audit the financial statements of subsidiaries Morepen Devices Limited, Morepen Rx Limited, Total Care Ltd., and Morepen Bio Inc. These were audited by other auditors, and the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, concerning these subsidiaries, is based solely on the reports of these other auditors. These subsidiaries represent total assets of ₹6032.60 lakhs and total revenue of ₹8970.56 lakhs for FY24.

No explicit qualifications were made in the auditor's opinion for either standalone or consolidated statements.
