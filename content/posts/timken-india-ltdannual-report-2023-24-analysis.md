## Financial Analysis Report: Timken India Limited (FY24)

### 3-Year Trend Analysis (FY22-FY24)

Timken India Limited has demonstrated a consistent growth trajectory over the past three fiscal years. Total income grew from ₹22,058 million in FY22 to ₹28,598 million in FY23, and further to ₹29,503 million in FY24, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15.6%. This growth was primarily driven by domestic sales.

Profit After Tax (PAT) increased from ₹3,276 million in FY22 to ₹3,907 million in FY23, and marginally to ₹3,921 million in FY24 (CAGR of 9.4%). The PAT margin saw a slight compression in FY24 (13.48%) compared to FY23 (13.92%), influenced by changes in other income (absence of one-time gains from FY23) and a marginal increase in total expense ratio. Earnings Per Share (EPS) followed a similar trend, rising from ₹43.56 in FY22 to ₹51.95 in FY23 and ₹52.13 in FY24.

Total Equity has steadily increased from ₹16,015 million in FY22 to ₹20,374 million in FY23, and ₹24,173 million in FY24, reflecting strong retained earnings. The company maintains a very low debt profile, with Total Debt to Total Equity ratio at 0.25% in FY24, down from 1.45% in FY23 and 1.80% in FY22. Return on Equity (RoE) was robust at 17.61% in FY24, though lower than 21.15% in FY23 and 21.80% in FY22, impacted by the larger equity base and near-flat PAT growth in FY24. Capital employed grew from ₹17,327 million in FY22 to ₹21,336 million in FY23, and ₹25,118 million in FY24, supporting business expansion.

## Timken India Limited (FY23-24) Financial Performance Analysis

### Overall Financial Performance & Key Highlights

Timken India Limited demonstrated resilience in FY23-24, achieving modest revenue growth of 3.7% to ₹29,095 million, an all-time high. Profit After Tax (PAT) saw a marginal increase of ₹14 million to ₹3,921 million, with Earnings Per Share (EPS) slightly improving to ₹52.13 from ₹51.95 in the previous year. The performance was primarily driven by strong domestic demand, particularly in the rail sector, which experienced double-digit growth. This offset a decline in export sales attributed to a global market slowdown. The company maintained a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow, with cash and investments increasing by 23.9% to ₹4,887 million.

### Economic and Market Environment

*   **Global Outlook:** The global economy is projected for steady but historically subdued growth (3.2% in 2024-2025, per IMF), impacted by high borrowing costs, geopolitical tensions (Ukraine, Red Sea crisis), and sluggish productivity. Inflation is expected to decline, potentially leading to interest rate reductions in major economies.
*   **Bearing Market:** The global bearing market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% from $50.9 billion in 2024 to 2030. The roller bearings segment (over 45% revenue share in 2023) and the automotive segment (49% market share) dominate. The railway and aerospace segments are poised for the fastest growth. The Indian bearing industry constitutes approximately 3.5% of global demand.
*   **Indian Economy:** India's economy expanded strongly at 8.4% in Q3 FY24, with projected GDP growth of 6.8% in 2024 (IMF). Growth is driven by government capital spending, domestic demand, and robust manufacturing and construction. India is expected to become the world's fourth-largest economy by 2025. Core inflation is at a 47-month low (3.53% in Jan 2024). Increased capex (₹11.11 lakh crores for infrastructure) in the interim budget 2024-25 is a positive driver.

### Sectoral Performance and Outlook (India)

Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, which for buildings and plant & equipment are sometimes lower than Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, supported by independent professional assessment. Freehold land is not depreciated.

*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value, with provisions for obsolescence.
*   **Financial Instruments:**
    *   *Financial Assets:* Initially at fair value. Subsequently, trade receivables and most other financial assets are at amortized cost. Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied, using a provision matrix for trade receivables based on historical default rates and forward-looking information. Investments in mutual funds are at FVTPL.
    *   *Financial Liabilities:* Initially at fair value. Subsequently, most financial liabilities (trade payables, borrowings) are at amortized cost using the EIR method.
*   **Revenue Recognition:** Sale of goods recognized upon transfer of control. Service income recognized as service is performed. Export incentives recognized when right to receive is established and realization is certain.
*   **Government Grants:** Asset-related grants are recognized as deferred revenue and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets. Other grants are recognized in P&L systematically.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Defined contribution schemes expensed as incurred. Defined benefit obligations (gratuity, long-term compensated absences) are based on actuarial valuations (projected unit credit method), with re-measurements recognized in OCI.
*   **Income Taxes:** Current tax based on taxable income. Deferred tax recognized using the balance sheet approach for temporary differences.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   **Auditor's Assessment:** The Statutory Auditors issued an unmodified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements as of March 31, 2024.
*   **Management's Assessment (Board's Report & MD&A):** The Company has designed and implemented internal control systems commensurate with its business. SAP ERP is integral. A Risk Management Committee is in place, and an enterprise-wide risk management framework (ISO 31000:2018 certified) is established. Risk-based internal audits are conducted by KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP. No significant material weaknesses or deficiencies were observed by management.
*   **Noted Deficiency in Record Keeping:** Both Statutory and Secretarial Auditors highlighted the failure to maintain daily backups of electronic books of account on servers physically located in India, as required by Rule 3(5) of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014. The Board's Report acknowledges this and states steps are being taken for implementation.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **Secretarial Audit (V Sreedharan and Associates):** Confirmed general compliance with applicable statutory provisions. Two observations were made:
    1.  The gap between two Risk Management Committee meetings (188 days) exceeded the stipulated 180 days (Regulation 21(3C) of SEBI LODR). The Board attributed this to "inadvertence."
    2.  Failure to maintain daily backups of electronic books of account on servers physically located in India.
*   **Corporate Governance Compliance Certificate (Practicing Company Secretary):** Certified compliance with mandatory Corporate Governance conditions under SEBI LODR, except for the Risk Management Committee meeting gap.
