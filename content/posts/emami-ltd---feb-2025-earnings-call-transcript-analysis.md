### Operational Changes

*   Focus on improving performance of The Man Company (TMC) post-transition, including addressing Quick Commerce shift.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

*   Mixed macroeconomic environment: Subdued urban demand vs. resilient rural demand.
*   Delayed winters impacting seasonal categories.
*   Shift in male grooming towards individuality, diversity, confidence, and holistic care.
*   Pressure on traditional Ayurvedic formats like Arishtha/Asava (impacting Pancharishta).
*   Growth in organized channels (MT, e-comm, Q-comm) continues, leading to channel conflict challenges.

### Competitive Positioning

*   Smart and Handsome rebranding aims to solidify leadership in the evolving male grooming market.
*   Kesh King decline attributed partly to category slowdown. Management sees minimal impact from Dabur's Sesa acquisition currently.
