## Risk Assessment

### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Scaling production to 4 million units by FY 2030-31, nearly doubling current output, poses significant strategic challenges.
*   **Likelihood:** High. The aggressive growth target (doubling output in 7-8 years, versus 40 years for the first 2 million) increases the probability of encountering execution challenges.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. The shift in operational scale and complexity presents a growing strategic risk.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** A dedicated organization for FY 2030-31 goals has been established. Digitalization is leveraged for data-driven decision-making.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. Early stages, measures in place, but success dependent on rapid adaptation and scaling.
*   **Potential Financial Impact**: The failure to manage scaling could lead to substantial financial losses.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Supply chain disruptions (natural disasters, human-made disasters) directly impact production capabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate to High. The document references past disruptions (COVID-19, semiconductor shortages) and ongoing geopolitical tensions.
*   **Trend:** Stable but with potential for volatility. Geopolitical and supply chain uncertainties persist.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Alternate suppliers, increased focus on localization, temporary inventory increases, use of technology for prevention and suppression of fire.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderate. Mitigation strategies are in place, but external factors remain a threat.
*   **Potential Financial Impact**: Major disruptions could halt production, leading to significant revenue losses.

### Financial Risks

*   **Severity:** Moderate. Exposure to fluctuating commodity prices (steel, aluminum, etc.) and foreign exchange rates (Yen, USD, Euro) are mentioned, directly impacting input costs.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Commodity prices and forex rates are inherently volatile.
*   **Trend:** Stable, but subject to market conditions.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Hedging instruments (forward contracts, options) are used, along with strategies such as bundling of sourcing and Value Analysis/Value Engineering (VA/VE).
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. Hedging mitigates some risk, but exposure remains.
*   **Potential Financial Impact**: Unfavorable movements can impact profitability. Cost optimization measures are cited to mitigate inflationary impacts, with cost savings from employee suggestion schemes.

### Compliance/Regulatory Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The document refers to "multidimensional and dynamic regulatory landscape." Non-compliance can lead to fines, liabilities, and reputational damage.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Continuous evolution of regulations (product, environmental, safety, data privacy) requires ongoing adaptation.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. Regulatory landscape is becoming more complex.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Strengthened IT-enabled controls, early warning systems, real-time tracking mechanisms, continuous strengthening of systems, processes.
*   **Control Effectiveness**: Appears effective. The Company states that, "The Company is compliant with all the applicable statutory compliances."
*   **Potential Financial Impact**: The penalties for non-compliance could be substantial, including potential liability.

### Emerging Risks

#### Cybersecurity Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The risk of cybercrime and downtime, information security threats.
*   **Likelihood:** Increasing. Due to the increase in digitalization of sales and service processes.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Establishment of a Security Operations Centre (SOC), sandboxing technology, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, data leak prevention, and user awareness programs.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderate. Measures are proactive, but constant vigilance is needed.
*   **Potential financial impact:** High.

#### Personal Data Privacy Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Potential for legal liabilities, reputational damage from breaches.
*   **Likelihood:** Increasing. Due to expansion of business operations.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implementation of policies, a governance structure, and technological solutions.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** The Company is actively implementing measures.
*   **Potential Financial Impact**: The penalties and customer compensations could be substantial.

#### Technological Disruption

*   **Severity**: High. The Company must adapt quickly to evolving technologies in order to satisfy the regulatory and customer demands.
*   **Likelihood**: Increasing. The EV market and alternate fuels may disrupt the ICE market.
*   **Trend**: Growing. The Company plans to expand into the EV market.
*   **Mitigation**: Working to launch six BEVs by FY 2030-31, the Company has also started a pilot biogas plant at its Manesar Facility.
