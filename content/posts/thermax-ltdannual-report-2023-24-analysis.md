The Group's debt structure consists of both non-current and current borrowings. The increase in non-current borrowings is related to long-term financing for projects. Current borrowings also increased, potentially to support working capital needs, which may be because of bio-CNG. Maturity profile needs closer examination of contractual payment terms (not fully disclosed)
