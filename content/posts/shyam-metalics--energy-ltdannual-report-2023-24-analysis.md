| Ratio                     | FY 2024    | FY 2023    | FY 2022    |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Return on Equity (ROE)    | 11.93%     | 13.71%     | 31.52%      |
| Return on Assets (ROA)    | 7.26%    | 7.60%    | 17.62%    |
| Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)| 11.77%    | 13.88%     | 34.45%       |
| EBITDA Margin             | 11.96%     | 11.84%    | 25.02%      |
| Net Profit Margin        | 7.80%     | 6.67%      | 16.58%     |

#### Analysis:

*   **Declining Profitability Trends:** Profitability ratios (ROE, ROA, and ROCE) show a declining trend from FY22 to FY24. This means that the ability to generate profits from shareholders equity, and every rupee of assets, has declined. This is driven, in part, by the substantial increase in the asset and equity base of the company due to expansion and capital investments.
*   **Margin Contraction:** The EBITDA and Net Profit Margins show significant decline. While the company maintained stable margin in the FY24 compared to previous year.

### Liquidity Metrics

| Ratio         | FY 2024 | FY 2023 |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Current Ratio | 1.53    | 1.38    |
| Quick Ratio   | 0.77    | 0.75  |
| Cash Ratio      |0.60     | 0.07  |

#### Analysis:
* Current ratio improved by 11% year on year, due to increase in Current Assets and decrease in Current Liabilities.
* Quick ratio slightly improved due to increase in cash and cash equivalents.
* Cash ratio increased significantly, due to increase in investments.

### Efficiency Ratios

| Ratio                  | FY 2024 | FY 2023   |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Asset Turnover         | 0.92    | 1.14    |
| Inventory Turnover     | 6.40   | 5.34    |
| Receivables Turnover   | 23.12  | 75.08  |

#### Analysis:
* Asset turnover ratio shows decline. This is becasue of the increase in total assets, as a result of capacity expansion.
* Inventory turnover ratio increased, due to increase in cost of materials consumed.
* Receivables turnover reduced significantly, as a result of increase in total trade receivables.

### Leverage Metrics

| Ratio                 | FY 2024 | FY 2023 |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Debt/Equity Ratio     | 0.06    | 0.13    |
| Interest Coverage Ratio|10.48  |14.17 |

#### Analysis:

*   **Low Leverage:** SMEL has a very low Debt/Equity ratio, indicating minimal reliance on debt financing. The company is primarily equity-financed. This decreased due to the repayment of a substantial portion of the borrowings.
*   **Strong Interest Coverage:** A very high interest coverage ratio signifies that the company has more than sufficient earnings to cover its interest expenses. It declined due to repayment of borrowings.

### Working Capital Ratios

| Ratio                       | FY 2024      | FY 2023  |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Net Working Capital Turnover|   2.72       |    3.56    |
| Working Capital Days            |   49.62       | 76.34      |
| Payable Days |103.24|110.51|

#### Analysis:

*   **Decreasing Net Working Capital Turnover:**. This indicates a decrease in the company's capital efficiency, requiring more capital to generate revenues.
*   **Decreasing Working Capital Days:**, indicates improved management and ability to convert its working capital into sales.
* Payable days decreased slightly.

### Key Observations and Recommendations:

*   **Strong Financial Position, Declining Profitability:** SMEL is in a very robust financial position with low debt, strong liquidity, and excellent interest coverage. However, the clear declining trends in profitability ratios (ROE, ROA, ROCE, and margins) are the *most significant* area of concern and should be the primary focus of management attention.
*   **Expansion and Capital Allocation:** The expansion plans and recent acquisitions (Mittal Corp) are likely major drivers of the changes in financial ratios. The increase in assets and equity has diluted return ratios. Management needs to demonstrate that these investments will generate sufficient returns in the future to justify the capital outlay. It's crucial to closely monitor the performance of new assets and acquisitions.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** There's room for improvement in asset turnover.  Increasing sales from the expanded capacity will be key to improving this.
*   **Working Capital Management:** While working capital days is improving, the payable days remain very high.
*   **Strategic Implications:**
    *   The company needs to focus on maximizing the utilization of its expanded capacities and driving revenue growth.
    *   Cost control measures are essential to improve margins, especially given the volatility in raw material prices (as mentioned in the Management Discussion & Analysis).
    *   The company's foray into stainless steel and aluminum foil is a diversification strategy. Management needs to ensure these new ventures are profitable.
    *   Given the low debt levels, there may be room for *strategic* borrowing if compelling, high-return investment opportunities arise. However, given the current downward trend in profitability ratios, it is not recommended until return on the investments improve.

### Summary:

SMEL's financial position is strong from a solvency and liquidity perspective. However, the declining profitability trends, along with the need to optimize the utilization of expanded capacities and new ventures, present challenges that require careful management attention and strategic execution. A focus on revenue growth, cost efficiency, and working capital optimization will be crucial for translating the company's strong financial foundation into sustained long-term profitability and shareholder value.

#### Analysis

*   **Operational Efficiency:** SMEL is actively mitigating risks through technology investments and process improvements.
*   **Raw Material Availability:** While captive sources are a strength, global supply chain issues could still impact the Company.
*   **Energy Costs:** High reliance on captive power generation significantly mitigates this risk.
*   **Logistics**:Strategic location of plant significantly mitigates the risk.
*    **Safety Risk:** The Zero incident indicates a positive trend.
