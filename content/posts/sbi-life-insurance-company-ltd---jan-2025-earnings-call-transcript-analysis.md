*   **Individual NBP:** INR 198.6 billion (9M FY25), +12% YoY. Private market share 27.8%. Q3 FY25 growth 10% (vs. 6% industry).
*   **Gross Written Premium (GWP):** INR 609.8 billion (9M FY25), +9% YoY.
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT):** INR 16 billion (9M FY25), +48% YoY. Management attributes strong PAT growth to investment income and a strong backbook (renewal premium +15%).
*   **Value of New Business (VoNB):** INR 42.9 billion (9M FY25), +6% YoY.
*   **VoNB Margin:** 26.9% (9M FY25). Management notes the shift is "mainly on account of increase in share of ULIP business as compared to previous period." They also noted a previous margin level around 31% had rationalized down to the current ~27%.

### Comparison

*   Strong PAT growth (48%) contrasts with modest VoNB growth (6%). Individual business growth (12% NBP, 14% IRP/APE) outpaced overall GWP growth (9%), indicating relative weakness in group business ("headwinds in group business, particularly with our group savings products"). Q3 Individual NBP growth (10%) beat the industry (6%). VoNB margin contracted compared to implied previous levels due to higher ULIP share, though management noted factors like non-par repricing, protection rider attachment, and better credit life reinsurance terms helped stabilize it sequentially in Q3.

### Guidance/Forecasts

*   Maintains guidance of ~15% Individual Rated Premium (IRP) / Individual APE growth for FY25.
*   Longer-term IRP/APE growth guidance: 15% to 17%.
*   VoNB growth for FY25 likely to be lower than APE growth, possibly single-digit or ~10%. Management: "there is a possibility that our VONB growth might be slightly lower than the APE growth."
*   Longer-term VoNB margin target range: 27% to 29%. Management: "Our objective is to maintain the margin in the range of 27% to 29% kind of thing."
*   Expects PAT growth to be around 10-15% YoY going forward, but highly dependent on product mix and market movements.

### Growth/Decline Areas

*   Strong growth in Individual business (especially Agency: +36% NBP, +31% Ind APE), ULIPs (+25% Ind NBP), PAT (+48%), AUM (+19%), Persistency. Decline/slowdown noted in Group Savings, overall Protection APE (-18% for 9M, though Individual Protection NBP grew 12% QoQ in Q3 vs Q2), and VoNB margin contraction YoY. Credit Life saw strong sequential (Q3 vs Q2) and YoY (Q3 vs Q3'24: +16%) growth.

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

### Major Strategic Announcements

*   Strong focus on strengthening the Agency channel ("Agency 2.0") through productivity improvements, agent recruitment, and branch expansion. Continued push on digitalization and leveraging the SBI YONO platform.

### New Products/Services/Markets

*   Launched "Smart Platina Supreme" (non-par guaranteed savings) in December, collecting over INR 2.5 billion premium in ~20 days. Management noted it has "better than the company margins."
*   Successfully leveraging the SBI YONO app for a simplified "3-click" protection product, selling over 73,000 policies in ~4 months, with a noticeable customer preference for pure protection over Return of Premium (ROP).
*   Launched protection riders attached to savings products with "encouraging" attachment rates, helping margins.

### Operational Changes

*   Branch Expansion: Opened 46 new branches in FY25 (by Dec '24), plan to add another 40 by March '25, targeting Tier 1-4 cities to support agency growth.
*   Agent Definition: Implemented a stricter definition for 'active agents', leading to a one-time higher deletion number (~40,000-45,000) in Q3 FY25. Added >75,000 gross agents in 9M FY25.
*   Digital Processing: 99% individual proposals submitted digitally; 50% processed via automated underwriting.

### Ongoing/Completed Projects

*   Agency 2.0 implementation appears ongoing and credited for productivity gains. Digital channel development within the SBI Banca relationship is yielding results (YONO product success).

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

*   Growth in ULIPs attributed to equity market movements ("evident across the industry"). Mentioned Swiss Re forecast for Indian industry growth at ~7.3% for the next 5 years. Customer shift towards pure protection observed in their YONO channel sales.

### Competitive Positioning

*   Maintained private market leadership in NBP (22.4%) and Individual NBP (27.8%). Outpacing industry growth in Individual NBP (10% vs 6% in Q3) and 3-year IRP CAGR (17% vs 13%). Largest agency channel in the private sector, second only to LIC overall. Highlighted very low misselling ratio (0.03%).

### Market Challenges/Opportunities

*   High base effect from Q3 FY24 acknowledged. Opportunity seen in low insurance penetration within the SBI customer base (~2.5-3%) and overall market. Significant opportunity identified in growing the agency channel. Navigating "noise" around potential bancassurance regulations.

### Market Share/Positioning

*   Explicitly stated market leadership in key segments. Management emphasized brand trust as a key advantage in agent recruitment despite not always competing aggressively on commission.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Acknowledged Concerns

*   High comparison base from Q3 FY24.
*   "Headwinds in group business, particularly with our group savings products."
*   Potential impact of equity market volatility on ULIP momentum (though management downplayed immediate linkage).
