## Overview
### Comprehensive Analysis


This analysis delves into Hawkins Cookers Limited's annual report for the fiscal year 2023-2024, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

Hawkins Cookers reported its highest-ever sales and profits in 2023-24.  Key financial highlights (in Rs. Crores unless otherwise specified):

* **Revenue from Operations:** Rs. 1024.15 (1.8% growth YoY).  This includes Other Operating Income.
* **Profit Before Tax (PBT):** Rs. 147.55 (16.3% growth YoY).
* **Profit After Tax (PAT):** Rs. 109.84 (15.9% growth YoY).
* **Net Worth/Shareholders' Funds:** Rs. 304.81 (24.6% growth YoY).
* **Return on Net Worth (RONW):** 36% (down from 39% in 2022-23).
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Rs. 208 (up from Rs. 179 in 2022-23).
* **Proposed Dividend:** Rs. 120 per equity share (up from Rs. 100 in 2022-23).

**Key Financial Ratios Analysis:**

* **Debt-Equity Ratio:** Decreased from 0.15 to 0.09, indicating improved financial health and reduced reliance on debt.  The reduction is attributed to increased profits and debt reduction.
* **Debt Service Coverage Ratio:** Decreased significantly from 16.72 to 5.68.  This decline is primarily due to a higher amount of fixed deposits taken by the company.  While this indicates increased short-term liabilities, the company’s cash position (see below) suggests manageable risk.
* **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Increased from 5.79 to 6.61, suggesting improved inventory management efficiency.  The company is selling its inventory quicker.
* **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:** Slightly improved from 20.07 to 21.53, indicating faster collection of receivables.
* **Trade Payables Turnover Ratio:** Slightly decreased from 16.74 to 16.15, showing a minor lengthening of the payment period to suppliers.
* **Net Profit Ratio:** Improved from 9.4% to 10.7%, showcasing higher profitability margins.
* **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** Slightly improved from 41% to 42%, indicating efficient utilization of capital.

**Cash Flow:**

The company's cash and cash equivalents increased significantly from Rs. 100.82 crores to Rs. 182.56 crores.  Cash flow from operations remained strong.

**II. Business Segments:**

Hawkins Cookers operates primarily in two segments:

* **Pressure Cookers and Cookware Manufacturing:** This constitutes the largest portion of revenue (79%), indicating a strong market position in the kitchenware industry.  The company launched 55 new products during the year, reflecting an active innovation strategy.
* **Wholesale Trading:** This segment accounts for 18% of the revenue, representing a secondary but significant revenue stream.

**III. Risks and Concerns:**

The annual report identifies several key risks:

* **Raw Material Costs:** Fluctuations in aluminum prices pose a significant risk to profitability.  While costs moderated during the year, future price trends remain unpredictable.
* **Competition:** The kitchenware market is competitive, with both organized and unorganized players.  Maintaining brand strength is crucial.
* **Inflation:** General inflation can impact consumer purchasing power, potentially affecting demand.

The company addresses these risks through efficient operations, cost control measures, new product launches, and brand building.  A Risk Management Committee oversees these matters.

**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

Hawkins Cookers' Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report highlights several ESG initiatives:

* **Environmental:**
    * Focus on reducing plastic usage in packaging (15% reduction).
    * 100% recyclable plastic packaging.
    * Operational ETPs (Effluent Treatment Plants) and STPs (Sewage Treatment Plants) with water recycling.
    * Significant reduction in particulate matter emissions (around 90%).
    * Energy conservation through solar panels, LED lighting, and energy-efficient fans.
    * Tree plantation initiatives (22,570 trees planted).
    * Implementation of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) at the Thane plant.
* **Social:**
    * Focus on employee well-being, including health insurance, safety measures, and skill development programs.
    * Equal Opportunity Policy.
    * CSR activities promoting healthcare, skill training, and donations.  Rs. 241.03 Lakhs spent exceeding the mandated 2% of average net profit.
    * Grievance redressal mechanisms for employees, workers, and stakeholders.
    * Efforts to reach out to unclaimed dividend and IEPF shareholders.
* **Governance:**
    * Strong corporate governance framework with a Board comprising Executive, Non-Executive, and Independent Directors.
    * Audit Committee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee, and Risk Management Committee in place.
    * Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
    * Vigil Mechanism/Whistleblower Policy.


**V. Overall Assessment:**

Hawkins Cookers Limited demonstrates strong financial performance in 2023-24, achieving record sales and profits.  The company shows proactive risk management and a commitment to sustainable and responsible business practices through its robust ESG initiatives.  While the significant decrease in the Debt Service Coverage Ratio warrants monitoring, the company's strong cash position and continued growth outlook suggest a positive trajectory.  The company's commitment to innovation, as evidenced by its numerous product launches, should ensure its continued competitiveness in the market.  However, continued vigilance regarding raw material price fluctuations and the competitive landscape is crucial for sustained success.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
Based on the provided Hawkins Cookers Limited Annual Report for 2023-2024, here are the values you requested (all figures in Rs. Lakhs):

* **Total Assets:** Rs. 52620.10
* **Current Assets:** Rs. 42690.84
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Rs. 1206.21  (This includes cash-in-hand, cash-at-bank in Current Accounts, and Term Deposits with maturities less than three months.)
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** Rs. 4770.81 (This is net of an allowance for credit impaired receivables.)
* **Inventory:** Rs. 14045.67 (This includes Raw Materials, Work-in-Progress, Finished Goods, and Stock-in-Trade.)


It's important to note that these are the reported values as of March 31, 2024.  Fluctuations are expected throughout the year.

### Liability Analysis
Here are the values for Hawkins Cookers Limited's liabilities as of March 31, 2024, from the provided annual report (all figures in Rs. Lakhs):

* **Total Liabilities:** Rs. 192,721.08 (This is calculated by subtracting total equity from total assets: 52620.10 - 33349.02 = 192721.08.  Note there is a discrepancy in the report totals.)
* **Current Liabilities:** Rs. 16977.56  (This includes short-term borrowings, trade payables, other current financial liabilities, other current liabilities, and provisions.)
* **Long-Term Debt (Borrowings):** Rs. 1347.56
* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** Rs. 6872.43 (This includes amounts due to micro and small enterprises and others.)

**Important Note:** There's a significant discrepancy between the total assets (Rs. 526,201.00) and total equity plus liabilities (Rs. 460,382.22 in the report).  This inconsistency needs to be clarified with the company as the numbers presented here reflect a calculation based on the provided report.  It may be an error in the original report's totaling.

### Equity Analysis
Here are the values for Hawkins Cookers Limited's equity components as of March 31, 2024, from the provided annual report (all figures in Rs. Lakhs):

* **Shareholders' Equity:** Rs. 33348.02 (This is the total equity, representing the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all its liabilities.)
* **Retained Earnings:** Rs. 27517.90 (This represents the accumulated profits of the company that have not been distributed as dividends.)
* **Share Capital:** Rs. 528.78 (This represents the total par value of the company's issued and outstanding shares.)


There is a significant difference between the reported total assets and the sum of total liabilities and equity within the report. This discrepancy should be further investigated.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Here's a summary of Hawkins Cooker's income statement figures for the year ended March 31, 2024, extracted from the provided annual report (all figures in Rs. Lakhs):

* **Revenue:** Rs. 103473.34 (This includes revenue from operations and other income.)
* **Cost of Revenue:** Rs. 47480.85 (This is a calculated value, not directly given, representing the sum of  Cost of materials consumed (Rs. 35362.55), Purchases of Stock-in-Trade (Rs. 12118.30), and Changes in inventories (Rs. 1818.70) )
* **Gross Profit:** Rs. 55992.49 (This is calculated as Revenue minus Cost of Revenue: 103473.34 - 47480.85 = 55992.49)
* **Operating Expenses:** Rs. 46828.28 (This includes Employee benefits expense, Finance costs, Depreciation and amortization expense, and Other expenses. Note that the report does not explicitly separate operating expenses; this value is estimated.)
* **Operating Income:** Rs. 9164.21 (This is calculated as Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses: 55992.49 - 46828.28 = 9164.21)


**Important Note:** The provided annual report doesn't explicitly categorize every expense item as either Cost of Revenue or Operating Expense. The values provided above for Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses are therefore *calculated estimates* based on a reasonable interpretation of the report data.  To obtain precise figures, refer to the original report's detailed breakdown of expenses.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Based on the provided Hawkins Cookers Limited annual report for the fiscal year 2023-2024:

* **Net Income:** Rs. 10983.60 Lakhs (This is the profit for the year after all expenses and taxes.)

* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):**  Rs. 156,23.32 Lakhs (This is calculated value, not explicitly stated.  It's found by adding back depreciation and amortization (Rs. 868.39 Lakhs), interest expense (Rs. 455.02 Lakhs), and income tax expense (Rs. 3771.33 Lakhs)  to the profit before tax (Rs. 14754.92 Lakhs).). Note:  Income tax expense is calculated considering both current and deferred tax.

* **Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Rs. 207.72 (This is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.)

* **Diluted EPS:** Rs. 207.72 (The report indicates that the basic and diluted EPS are the same.)


**Important Note:**  The EBITDA calculation is an approximation, as the report doesn't provide a clear breakdown of all relevant expenses.  The income tax calculation requires careful analysis due to current and deferred tax components.  Always refer to the original report for the most precise numbers.

### Cash Flow Components
Hawkins Cooker's Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 shows the following (all figures in Rs. Lakhs):

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** Rs. 174,25.99 Lakhs (This represents the cash generated from the company's core business operations, after adjusting for changes in working capital.)

* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** Rs. -103,55.49 Lakhs  (This is a net outflow and includes the purchase of property, plant, and equipment, and interest and dividend receipts.)

* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** Rs. -70,07.27 Lakhs (This is a net outflow and includes the proceeds from and repayment of fixed deposits and finance costs paid.)


It's important to note that these figures are presented *net* of several components and may include adjustments for non-cash items.  Refer to the original statement of cash flows in the annual report for detailed breakdowns.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The Hawkins Cookers Limited annual report doesn't directly provide a single-line "Free Cash Flow" figure.  We need to calculate it using the information available.  Similarly, dividends paid aren't explicitly stated for the current year. Here's what we can determine:


* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** Rs. 25,62.24 Lakhs (This is inferred from the cash flow statement, representing the net outflow for "Purchase of property, plant, and equipment," after considering the sale proceeds)

* **Dividends Paid:**  The report indicates the *proposed* dividend for 2023-24 is Rs. 120 per share, but the *actual* amount *paid* during this fiscal year is not explicitly stated.  This would need to be found in a separate section of the annual report or other financial disclosure. To find this value, you would need to look for details related to dividend distribution in the report, possibly in the notes to the financial statements or the director's report.


* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This requires calculation and there's some ambiguity due to the report presentation. A reasonable approximation would be:

    FCF ≈ Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures

    FCF ≈ Rs. 17425.99 Lakhs - Rs. 2562.24 Lakhs  ≈ Rs. 14863.75 Lakhs

This calculation is an *estimate*. A more precise FCF calculation might include other factors depending on the company's specific accounting practices (e.g., changes in working capital, other investing activities).  Again, the original report should be reviewed for a complete and precise FCF calculation if needed.

### Profitability Ratios
We need to calculate Hawkins Cooker's profitability ratios using the figures previously extracted from the annual report.  Remember these are approximations due to some ambiguities in the report's presentation of expenses:


* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100  = (55992.49 Lakhs / 103473.34 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 54.1%

* **Operating Profit Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (9164.21 Lakhs / 103473.34 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 8.8%

* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (10983.60 Lakhs / 103473.34 Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 10.6%

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (10983.60 Lakhs / ((27613.04 + 32819.24)/2) Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 36.2%

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (10983.60 Lakhs / ((46038.22 + 52620.10)/2) Lakhs) * 100 ≈ 20.9%


**Important Considerations:**

* **Expense Classification:** The annual report doesn't clearly separate all operating expenses from cost of goods sold, leading to potential minor inaccuracies in the gross and operating margins.  A more detailed breakdown of expenses from the company's books would be required for higher precision.
* **Average Equity/Assets:**  The ROE and ROA calculations use the average of beginning and ending equity and assets for the year.
* **Rounding:**  Rounding of numbers throughout these calculations might introduce minor variations from the results obtained using the raw, unrounded numbers from the report.


These ratios provide a general understanding of Hawkins Cooker's profitability.  For more precise figures, consult the company's detailed financial statements.

### Liquidity Ratios
Let's calculate Hawkins Cookers' liquidity ratios using the figures previously extracted from the annual report.  Remember that these are approximations due to some ambiguities in how the report presents certain liability figures:

* **Current Ratio:** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = (42690.84 Lakhs / 16977.56 Lakhs) ≈ 2.51

* **Quick Ratio:** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (42690.84 Lakhs - 14045.67 Lakhs) / 16977.56 Lakhs ≈ 1.69

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = (1206.21 Lakhs / 16977.56 Lakhs) ≈ 0.07


**Important Considerations:**

* **Liability Discrepancies:**  The original report shows a large discrepancy between the reported total assets and the sum of total liabilities and shareholders' equity. This means the calculated current liabilities used in these ratios may not be entirely accurate.  The correct values should be obtained from the company's corrected report.
* **Inventory Valuation:** The inventory figure used in the quick ratio calculation is based on the reported value; however, the true liquidity of inventory depends on how quickly it can be converted to cash.

These ratios provide a general assessment of Hawkins Cooker's short-term debt-paying ability.  For precise figures, you should consult the company's corrected financial statements.

### Efficiency Ratios
Here's a calculation of Hawkins Cookers' efficiency ratios using data from the annual report.  Remember that these are approximations due to potential inaccuracies and ambiguities in the reporting:


* **Asset Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Total Assets) = (103473.34 Lakhs / ((46038.22 + 52620.10) / 2) Lakhs) ≈ 2.01

* **Inventory Turnover:** (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory) = (47480.85 Lakhs / ((16956.37 + 14045.67) / 2) Lakhs) ≈ 2.74

* **Receivables Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable) = (103473.34 Lakhs / ((4741.56 + 4770.81) / 2) Lakhs) ≈ 21.8


**Important Considerations:**

* **Average Values:**  The calculations use the average of the beginning and ending balances for assets, inventory, and receivables.
* **Cost of Goods Sold:**  The cost of goods sold (COGS) used in the inventory turnover calculation is an estimated figure.  The company's detailed income statement would be needed for higher precision.  Additionally, the inventory turnover ratio only indicates how well the company manages its inventory and does not necessarily indicate whether its sales are profitable.
* **Report Discrepancies:** The significant difference between the total assets and the sum of liabilities and shareholders' equity in the original report might affect the accuracy of the asset turnover ratio. The calculations here should be verified once the corrected report is available.



These ratios offer insights into how efficiently Hawkins Cookers utilizes its assets and manages its inventory and receivables.  For exact figures, refer to the company's fully reconciled and corrected financial statements.

### Leverage Ratios
Let's calculate Hawkins Cookers' leverage ratios, keeping in mind the potential inaccuracies due to the reporting discrepancies noted earlier:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity = (1347.56 Lakhs + 1788.33 Lakhs) / 33348.02 Lakhs ≈ 0.09

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets = (1347.56 Lakhs + 1788.33 Lakhs) / 52620.10 Lakhs ≈ 0.06

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense = (15623.32 Lakhs) / 455.02 Lakhs ≈ 34.3


**Important Considerations:**

* **Total Debt:** This calculation uses both short-term and long-term borrowings.
* **EBIT Calculation:** The EBIT used for the interest coverage ratio is an estimated value (see previous responses). A more precise figure from the company's detailed statements would provide a more accurate ratio.
* **Reporting Errors:** The significant discrepancies in the annual report's financial statement totals could impact the accuracy of these leverage ratios.  The values reported here are based on the provided statements and should be verified once the corrected report is released.


These leverage ratios give an indication of Hawkins Cooker's financial risk, reflecting its use of debt financing.  For reliable and precise results, use the company's corrected financial statements.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided annual report does *not* contain information on market capitalization, Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, Price-to-Book (PB) ratio, dividend yield, or dividend payout ratio.  These are market-based metrics requiring share price data and total number of outstanding shares, which are not included in the document.  To calculate these, you'll need to obtain the current market price of Hawkins Cookers' shares from a financial website (like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg) and then perform the calculations using the values from the annual report.

Here's how those ratios are calculated:

* **Market Capitalization (Market Cap):** Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share (Shareholder's Equity / Number of Outstanding Shares)

* **Dividend Yield:** Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share * 100

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** Annual Dividends Paid / Net Income * 100


Once you obtain the current market price per share for Hawkins Cookers, you can use the EPS and book value per share from this annual report (as previously determined in this conversation) to calculate the required ratios. Remember that these ratios are snapshots in time and will change daily with the market price.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
Hawkins Cookers Limited's annual report does not provide a detailed breakdown of segment information beyond stating that the company operates primarily in two segments:

1. **Pressure Cookers and Cookware Manufacturing:** This is the main segment, accounting for 79% of total revenue (Rs. 1024.15 crores).  The report does *not* give the segment's revenue in isolation. The annual report does not provide specific growth rates, operating margins, or market share data for this segment.  Key products include various pressure cookers (tri-ply stainless steel, etc.) and cookware (tri-ply stainless steel, cast iron). The geographic presence is extensive within India (28 states and 7 union territories) and includes exports to 32 countries.

2. **Wholesale Trading:** This segment contributes 18% to total revenue. Again, no isolated segment revenue is provided.  No details are given on growth rate, operating margin, market share, specific products, or geographic reach within this segment.


**Missing Information:**  The annual report lacks crucial details needed for a complete segment analysis:

* **Isolated Segment Revenue:**  The report only gives the percentage contribution of each segment to total revenue, not their individual revenue values.
* **Growth Rates:**  Year-over-year or other growth rates are not provided for either segment.
* **Operating Margins:**  Operating margins for each segment are not reported.
* **Market Shares:**  No market share data is given for either segment in any geographic area.


To obtain this missing information, you would need to consult additional resources such as industry reports, company presentations, or contact the company's investor relations department directly.

### Risk Assessment
The Hawkins Cookers Limited annual report identifies several key risk factors, but it doesn't provide a structured assessment using standardized categories (like impact severity and likelihood).  However, we can organize the risks found into categories and discuss their potential impact:

**I. Raw Material Risk:**

* **Category:** Supply Chain Risk, Operational Risk, Financial Risk
* **Description:** Fluctuations in the price and availability of aluminum, the primary raw material, significantly impact production costs and profitability.
* **Potential Impact:** Increased production costs, reduced profit margins, potential for price increases to consumers.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**  The company seeks to mitigate this risk through efficient procurement and production processes, and by monitoring and forecasting market price trends.


**II. Competitive Risk:**

* **Category:** Market Risk
* **Description:** Intense competition in the kitchenware market from both organized and unorganized players.
* **Potential Impact:** Reduced market share, pressure on pricing, decreased profitability.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**  Maintaining brand strength, product innovation (frequent new product launches), effective marketing and distribution strategies.

**III. Inflationary Risk:**

* **Category:** Market Risk, Financial Risk
* **Description:**  General inflation can reduce consumer purchasing power, leading to decreased demand for Hawkins' products.
* **Potential Impact:** Reduced sales volume, potential for price increases to consumers.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**  Effective cost control, efficient production to offset rising prices, and strategies to maintain affordability.


**IV.  Other Risks (Less Explicitly Defined):**

* **Exchange Rate Risk:** Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could impact export revenues, though the company states this risk is currently minimal due to advance payments.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in regulations related to manufacturing, safety standards, or other areas could necessitate adjustments in operations.
* **Operational Risk:** Issues with production processes, supply chain disruptions (beyond raw material costs), or quality control could affect output and sales.

**Missing Information:**

The annual report lacks a formal risk assessment matrix that quantifies the likelihood and potential impact of each risk factor.  Therefore, a detailed assessment of impact severity and likelihood cannot be fully provided here. The report does mention a Risk Management Committee, suggesting internal efforts to manage these risks.

**Trends:**  The report hints at several trends:  increased competition, fluctuating raw material prices (though recent moderation was seen), and the potential for sustained inflation.  These trends need to be analyzed further based on external economic and industry data.


To get a more complete understanding of Hawkins Cookers' risk profile,  one would need access to more granular company data (internal risk assessments) or consult external research reports on the kitchenware industry and macroeconomic conditions.



## Strategic Overview
### Management Assessment
Hawkins Cookers Limited's management highlights several key aspects of their business strategy, competitive advantages, market conditions, challenges, and opportunities in the annual report:

**I. Key Strategies:**

**III. Market Conditions:**

* **Competitive Market:** The kitchenware industry in India is described as competitive, with both organized and unorganized sector players.
* **Fluctuating Raw Material Prices:**  Aluminum prices show volatility, which impacts production costs.  The report notes moderation in prices during the reported year but acknowledges the unpredictable nature of future trends.
* **Inflationary Pressure:** General inflation poses a risk to consumer purchasing power, which could affect demand.


**IV. Challenges:**

* **Raw Material Price Volatility:**  Aluminum price fluctuations are a major challenge, directly impacting margins.
* **Intense Competition:**  Maintaining market share against numerous competitors requires constant innovation and brand management.
* **Inflationary Impact on Consumer Spending:** Inflation's potential to dampen consumer demand represents a significant ongoing challenge.


**V. Opportunities:**

* **Growing Demand:** The overall market for kitchenware shows potential for growth.  This is an opportunity for Hawkins to expand its market share.
* **Product Diversification:**  The launch of new products in different material types and designs indicates opportunities to expand product lines and cater to diverse customer segments.
* **Export Market Expansion:**  While exports are currently a smaller part of revenue, there's an opportunity for greater penetration in international markets.


**In summary:** Hawkins Cookers focuses on innovation, brand building, and efficiency to navigate a competitive market with volatile raw material prices and inflationary pressures. The company sees opportunities in growing market demand, product line expansion, and international expansion.  However, the success of these strategies will largely depend on their ability to effectively manage the challenges identified.

### ESG Ratings
The provided annual report does **not** include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  The report details Hawkins Cookers' ESG initiatives and performance, but it does not cite any scores or rankings from organizations like MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, or others that provide such evaluations.  To find ESG ratings for Hawkins Cookers Limited, you would need to consult databases of ESG ratings provided by these agencies or other financial data providers.

### ESG Initiatives
Hawkins Cookers Limited's annual report details various ESG initiatives, but it lacks specific quantifiable targets for some areas.  Here's a summary based on the report:


**I. Environmental Initiatives:**

* **Waste Management:**  The company focuses on reducing, reusing, and recycling waste.  They aim for 100% recyclable plastic packaging and highlight initiatives to reduce plastic usage.  Specific metrics on waste reduction, recycling rates, and disposal methods are provided but lack a clear baseline against which to measure progress.
* **Water Management:**  Hawkins operates ETPs (Effluent Treatment Plants) and STPs (Sewage Treatment Plants) at all its plants.  Treated water is recycled. Specific data on water consumption and discharge is given.  Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) is implemented at their Thane plant.
* **Energy Efficiency:**  The company is implementing energy-saving measures, including solar panel installations, LED lighting, and energy-efficient fans.  Data on energy consumption and intensity is provided but lacks sufficient detail for meaningful trend analysis.
* **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:** The company reports Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions but doesn't provide a detailed Scope 3 assessment or clear targets for emission reduction. Data on specific GHGs are given.  They highlight initiatives like installing RECDs (Retrofit Emission Control Devices) on DG sets to reduce emissions.
* **Air Emissions:**  The company monitors and reports air emissions (NOx, SOx, PM, VOCs, HAPs).  Specific data is provided, but no clear reduction targets are stated.


**II. Carbon Footprint:**

The report provides data on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions but lacks a comprehensive assessment of Scope 3 emissions (value chain emissions).  While specific initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon footprint are highlighted, specific reduction targets are not stated.


**III. Social Initiatives:**

* **Employee Well-being:** The company focuses on employee health and safety, offering various benefits and conducting training programs on safety, health, and skill development. Specific data on health insurance coverage, safety incidents, and training programs are given.
* **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):**  Hawkins has a CSR program that includes activities in healthcare (donations to eye hospitals), skill development (apprenticeship training), and community development (public awareness campaigns on fuel-efficient cooking practices).  Specific amounts spent on CSR initiatives are reported.


**IV. Governance Practices:**

* **Board Structure:**  The company has a diverse board comprising executive, non-executive, and independent directors.  Various board committees (audit, nomination & remuneration, stakeholders' relations, risk management) are in place to ensure effective governance.
* **Ethical Conduct:**  A corporate governance code of conduct and a whistleblower policy are in place to promote ethical business practices.
* **Transparency and Disclosure:** The company aims for transparency in its reporting and disclosures.


**V. Sustainability Goals:**

The annual report doesn't explicitly state overarching sustainability goals in a clear, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) format.  While various environmental and social initiatives are described, the report lacks explicit, quantitative targets for specific sustainability metrics.  For example, there's no stated goal for reducing water consumption by a certain percentage, lowering carbon emissions by a specific amount by a certain year, or achieving a specific score on a recognized ESG rating scale.


To fully assess Hawkins Cookers' sustainability goals, one would need to find supplementary information beyond the annual report, perhaps in dedicated sustainability reports or communications from the company.



## Additional Information

### Audit Information
**Auditor's Opinion:**

The independent auditor, Kalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on Hawkins Cookers Limited's financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. This means the auditors found the financial statements to be presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The audit report also includes a section detailing "Key Audit Matters," which highlights the most significant areas assessed during the audit process (related to accounting for discounts, incentives, and volume rebates).


**Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report outlines several key accounting policies employed by Hawkins Cookers.  These include (but are not limited to):

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):**  PPE is recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  Freehold land is not depreciated.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. Impairment testing is performed if indicators of impairment exist.

* **Inventories:**  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV).  Raw materials are valued using the weighted average cost method.  Other inventories use the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method.

* **Financial Instruments:**  Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends on the instrument's classification (amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss).  Impairment is assessed for financial assets based on expected credit losses.

* **Revenue Recognition:**  Revenue is recognized under the principles of Ind AS 115, when control of the goods is transferred to the customer.  Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives, and volume rebates.

* **Employee Benefits:**  Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund, etc.) are expensed as incurred.  Defined benefit plans (Gratuity) are measured using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial gains and losses recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

* **Taxes on Income:**  The company recognizes current and deferred tax expenses/income.  Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it's probable that future taxable profits will be available.

* **Foreign Currency Transactions:**  Foreign currency transactions are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates.  Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the profit and loss statement.

* **Segment Reporting:**  Hawkins reports as a single segment because the internal reporting structure is unified, focusing on the manufacturing, trading, and sales of kitchenware.

* **Borrowing Costs:**  Borrowing costs are capitalized for qualifying assets and expensed otherwise.

These key accounting policies form the basis for preparing and presenting the company's financial statements.  A thorough understanding of these policies is crucial for interpreting the financial information presented in the report.  Always refer to the detailed accounting policies section of the annual report for comprehensive details.
