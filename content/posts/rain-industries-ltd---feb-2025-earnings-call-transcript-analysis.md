*   Carbon segment revenue decreased 10.9% YoY due to ~16.0% lower blended realizations, despite higher volumes (from Indian plant utilization). Adj. EBITDA increased due to volumes, cost optimization, and FX, offsetting lower prices.
*   Advanced Materials segment revenue increased 7.3% YoY driven by higher volumes (Chemical Intermediates), offsetting a 3.6% decrease in blended realization. Adj. EBITDA increased significantly YoY.
*   Cement segment revenue declined sharply (-38.1% YoY) due to lower realization (-12.4%) and volumes (-29.4%). Adj. EBITDA saw a significant downturn (-₹657 million YoY).

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

### Major Strategic Announcements

*   Reinstatement of the "global blend strategy" for CPC, leveraging global assets, enabled by the relaxation of Indian import restrictions after six years.
*   Announcements regarding a new R&D lab and demonstration plant for Energy Storage Materials and Battery Anode Materials (BAM) in Canada.

### New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed

*   Significant focus on the Battery Anode Materials (BAM) market, both as a source of competition for GPC raw material and as a future growth area for RAIN.

### Significant Operational Changes

*   Cost reduction efforts: "optimizing operations at our manufacturing plants and adjusting our global workforce to match current demand conditions."
*   Ramping up production capacity at the vertical shaft calciner in the SEZ plant in India.
*   Implementation of International Safety Standards in the Cement Business.

### Ongoing or Completed Projects

*   Ongoing ramp-up of the vertical shaft calciner in India.
*   Planned development of the BAM R&D/demonstration facility in Canada.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

*   **Aluminium:** Global outlook positive, prices stable (~$2,600/t), low LME inventories despite record production (+3% YoY in 2024). Future smelting growth led by India/Indonesia (2025) and ex-China projects (2026).
