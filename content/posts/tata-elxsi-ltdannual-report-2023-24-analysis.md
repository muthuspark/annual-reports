## Risk Framework

### Software Development & Services (SDS)

#### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The SDS segment's growth (12.8% in FY 2023-24) is vulnerable to shifts in client spending, particularly in the Media & Communications vertical,which only saw marginal revenue growth protection of 0.2%.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. The document notes a "softening of the market situation" in Media & Communications.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. Dependence on key verticals (Transportation, Media & Communications, Healthcare) intensifies the impact of sector-specific downturns. Revenue concentration from top 10 clients increased YOY from 48.1% to 53.1%.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Vertical and client diversification efforts show a mixed result. The shift in focus is resulting in significant revenue increase from operators (70% of vertical's total business.)
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. The Company needs to demonstrate greater progress in mitigation given the rising concentration risk.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant. Revenue deceleration or decline in key verticals, especially Transportation (24.6% YoY growth), could substantially impact overall SDS revenue.

#### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Dependence on skilled talent is a key operational risk.
*   **Likelihood**: Medium, the document mentions consistent need for "upgradation of high-end skills".
*   **Trend:** Stable. Attrition rate improved to 12.4% in 2023-24, but this needs continuous management.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Investment in employee learning and development programs (Learnify Policy, tailored learning paths) and an employee value proposition.
