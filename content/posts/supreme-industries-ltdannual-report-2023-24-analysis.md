*   Related party transaction details are provided in Note 39 of the standalone financial statements and Form AOC-2 (Annexure VI to the Board's Report).

#### Subsequent Events

*   No material changes or commitments affecting the financial position of the Company occurred after the balance sheet date (31st March, 2024) that requires disclosure.
*   The Board of Directors has proposed a final dividend of ₹ 22 per share, subject to shareholder approval.

#### Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The unqualified audit opinion, adherence to Ind AS, and consistent application of accounting policies support a high level of accounting quality. The use of external auditors for branch audits and independent valuers for business combinations further enhances the reliability of financial reporting.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The Company demonstrates a robust approach to regulatory compliance, supported by its compliance with SEBI regulations, credit rating affirmations, and the absence of any non-compliances raised by regulatory authorities. The proactive management of legal proceedings suggests a moderate regulatory risk profile. The transition to an audit trail-enabled accounting system enhances data integrity and reduces the risk of non-compliance with emerging regulatory requirements.
