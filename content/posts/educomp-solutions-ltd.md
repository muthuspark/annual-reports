### 2. Business Segment Performance

| Segment                      | Revenue (2023-24) | Expenses (2023-24) | Results (2023-24) | Revenue (2022-23) | Expenses (2022-23) | Results (2022-23) |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
| Higher Learning Solutions    |         -         |         -          |         -         |         -         |         -          |         -         |

**Key Observations:**

-   School Learning Solutions is the only segment generating revenue, though it operated at a significant loss in FY2023-24.
-   Other segments are not generating any revenue, suggesting a potential need for restructuring or divestment.

### 3. Major Strategic Initiatives and Their Progress

**Key Initiatives:**

-   **Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP):** Initiated on May 30, 2017. A resolution plan was approved by the NCLT on October 9, 2023. However the Successful Resolution Applicant (SRA) has not implemented the approved Resolution Plan. As of November 23, 2023, the Resolution Professional (RP) was directed to act as a caretaker, discharging functions similar to an Interim Resolution Professional. The case is currently with NCLT and future of the company depends on the implementation of the resolution.
-	**SFIO and CBI investigation:** The affairs of the Company is currently under investigation.

**Progress:**

-   CIRP: The process is ongoing, with the resolution plan facing legal challenges and non-implementation by the SRA.
-   Investigations: The investigations are ongoing, impacting company stability.

### 4. Risk Landscape Changes

**Key Risks:**

-   **Financial Risk:** The company's CIRP status indicates a high level of financial risk, including default on debt obligations, negative working capital, and eroded net worth.
-   **Operational Risk:** Suspension of the Board's powers and reduced staff levels pose operational risks, hindering regular business activities and compliance.
- **Legal and Regulatory Risk:** Ongoing investigations by SFIO and CBI add to the legal and regulatory risks, with potential penalties and reputational damage.
- **Market Risk:** Changes in the exchange rate.
- **Credit Risk:** For trade and other receivables
- **Liquidity Risk:** The inability of the Company to meet its obligations.

**Changes:**

-   The approval of the resolution plan in October 2023 initially signaled a potential reduction in financial risk, but the subsequent legal challenges and non-implementation have increased uncertainty.
-   The operational risk remains high due to the CIRP status and limited staff.

### 5. ESG Initiatives and Metrics

The provided report does not contain specific metrics or detailed disclosures regarding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report indicates a CSR policy, but no CSR expenditure occurred due to company losses and CIRP status.

### 6. Management Outlook

The management outlook remains highly uncertain due to the ongoing CIRP and associated legal proceedings. The future of the company is contingent on the implementation of the resolution plan, which is currently facing significant challenges. The report indicates that the company might be liquidated if no resolution is achieved.

### Comparative Analysis with Industry Averages

Due to the company's unique situation under CIRP, a direct comparison with industry averages for financial metrics is not meaningful. Key performance indicators such as profitability, solvency, and liquidity ratios are significantly below industry norms, reflecting the company's distressed financial state.

The education technology sector, in general, experiences growth and opportunities driven by digitalization and government initiatives. However, Educomp Solutions Limited is not currently positioned to capitalize on these trends due to its ongoing financial and operational challenges.

### 4. Dividend and Share Buyback Trends
    Not applicable, no payment.

### 5. Debt Service Coverage

-   Due to negative earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), a traditional debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) cannot be meaningfully calculated.

### 6. Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

| Metric                                 | FY2023-24  | FY2022-23  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |

| Cash Ratio (Consolidated, approximate) | 0.01         |0.02     |
| Cash Conversion Cycle                    |   Not meaningful          |Not meaningful|
Due to financial difficulties and ongoing CIRP process.

### 7. Free Cash Flow Yield

-   Free Cash Flow Yield cannot be meaningfully calculated due to negative free cash flow.

## Peer Comparison:

It is very difficult to create a peer comparison, due to the limited data available for public review.

## Forward Projections (Based on Historical Trends and Significant Assumptions):
Due to company's situation of undergoing insolvency, the analysis and forward projection cannot be made.

* *NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate). Invested Capital = Total Assets - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt). Need additional financial Data.*
* *Industry average for the education technology sector is for illustrative purposes only. Actual industry data can vary significantly.*
* *Educomp has loss before tax.So, ROIC is not calculated.*

**2. Liquidity Ratios**

**(Consolidated Basis)**

| Ratio          | Formula                      | 2024     | 2023     |Industry Average Deviation|

| Inventory Turnover Ratio  | (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory)*    |   -       |  -        |   Not Calculable. Requires COGS           |
| Receivables Turnover Ratio | (Revenue / Average Trade Receivables)      |  0.04     |    0.03      |    Significantly lower than industry average, suggesting collection issues.      |
* *Industry averages are illustrative, focusing on the broader technology sector rather than solely education technology.*

**4. Leverage Ratios**

**(Consolidated Basis)**

| Ratio                 | Formula                                  | 2024     | 2023     |Industry Average Deviation       |

| Debt-to-Equity Ratio  | (Total Debt / Total Equity)             | -0.88    | -0.87  | High, negative equity exacerbates. |
| Interest Coverage Ratio* | (EBIT / Interest Expense)              | Needs calculation     |   Needs calculation     | Not Calculable. Requires EBIT.    |

* *Industry averages are for illustrative benchmarks. Significant deviations should be highlighted.*
* *Educomp has loss before tax.So, interest coverage ratio is not calculated.*

**5. Segment-wise ROIC**

ROIC calculation per segment is not feasible without segment-specific EBIT and invested capital data.

**6. Working Capital Ratios**

**(Consolidated Basis)**

| Ratio                            | Formula                                                 | 2024      | 2023     |Industry Average Deviation|
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |----------------------------|
| Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)     | (Average Trade Receivables / Revenue) * 365             |   9565.79   |   10791.69    |  Extremely high, major issue.    |
| Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) | (Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365*         |   -       |      -     |  Not Calculable. Requires COGS.           |
| Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)   | (Average Trade Payables / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365*    |   -       | -            | Not Calculable. Requires COGS.            |
| Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)     | (DIO + DSO - DPO)                                       | Needs Calculation|   Needs calculation      |  Needs calculation       |

* *Industry averages are for illustrative benchmarks, with a general focus, not solely educational technology.*
* * Educomp has losses. So, few ratios can not be calcluated.*

**Key Deviations and Highlights:**

*   **Extremely Low Profitability:**  All profitability margins are strongly negative, indicating significant losses relative to revenue.
*   **Very Weak Liquidity:** Current, quick, and cash ratios are all extremely low, suggesting a severe inability to meet short-term obligations.
*   **Poor Asset Utilization:** The asset turnover ratio is very low, meaning assets are not generating sufficient revenue.
*   **High Leverage/Negative Equity:** Debt-to-equity is negative due to negative equity, showing severe financial distress.
*   **Extremely High DSO:** Days Sales Outstanding is extraordinarily high, implying major problems with collecting receivables.
*	**Absence of COGS:** This means that many working capital and Inventory related ratios can't be calculated.

This analysis, limited by available data and no COGS data, consistently points towards a company in extreme financial distress with performance metrics far below any reasonable industry benchmarks.

-   **CIRP Status:** Management acknowledges ongoing CIRP, approval of a resolution plan by the NCLT, and subsequent non-implementation by the Successful Resolution Applicant (SRA).
-**Operational Status:** Assumes ability to progressively ramp up operations.

## Scenario Analysis

**Scenario 1: Successful Resolution Plan Implementation**

-   **Assumptions:**
    -   SRA implements the resolution plan.
    -   Debt restructuring is achieved.
    -   New management takes control.
    -   Access to new funding is secured.
-   **Outcomes:**
    -   Improved financial stability.
    -   Potential for operational ramp-up.
    -   Ability to pursue market opportunities.
    -   Gradual recovery and potential for long-term growth.

**Scenario 2: Continued CIRP Uncertainty**

-   **Assumptions:**
    -   The resolution plan remains unimplemented.
    -   Legal challenges and delays continue.
    -   No new funding is secured.
-   **Outcomes:**
    -   Continued operational constraints.
    -   Further deterioration of financial position.
    -   Increased risk of liquidation.
    -   Limited ability to capitalize on market opportunities.

**Scenario 3: Liquidation**

-   **Assumptions:**
    -   No viable resolution plan is implemented.
    -   The company is ordered into liquidation.
-   **Outcomes:**
    -   Assets are sold to repay creditors.
    -   Operations cease.
    -   Shareholders likely receive minimal or no recovery.

## Sensitivity to Key Assumptions

-   **Resolution Plan Implementation:** This is the most critical assumption. The company's future is entirely dependent on a successful resolution.
-   **Funding Access:** The ability to secure new funding, either through the resolution plan or external sources, is crucial for any recovery.
-   **Market Conditions:** While the education sector is growing, Educomp's ability to benefit depends on its financial and operational recovery.
-   **Regulatory Changes:** Any adverse changes in regulations could further hinder recovery.
-   **Management Effectiveness:** Post-resolution, the new management's ability to execute a turnaround strategy will be critical.

The analysis reveals a company facing extreme uncertainty. The outcome hinges almost entirely on the resolution of the CIRP. While market opportunities exist, the company's ability to capitalize on them is severely constrained by its current financial and legal situation.

**Accounting Quality Analysis**

*   **Low.** The adverse auditor's opinion, numerous qualifications, material uncertainty regarding going concern, and lack of internal controls indicate poor accounting quality. The absence of crucial financial information, non-compliance with accounting standards, and lack of up-to-date records further support this assessment.

**Regulatory Risk Assessment**

*   **High.** Significant non-compliance with multiple regulations (Companies Act, SEBI LODR, FEMA, GST Act) and ongoing investigations by SFIO, CBI, and SEBI demonstrate a high level of regulatory risk. The failure to adhere to statutory requirements and potential penalties expose the Company to substantial legal and financial repercussions. The suspension of the Board's powers and the ongoing CIRP further elevate the regulatory risk.
