### Risk Landscape Changes

The company identifies credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk (interest rate, price, foreign currency, prepayment), and operational/business cycle risk as primary exposures.

*   **Credit Risk:**
    *   **Gold Loans:** Considered low risk due to collateral (gold ornaments), LTV margins (minimum 25%), quick appraisal, and auction policy. Sentimental value of gold also encourages redemption.
    *   **Non-Gold Loans:** More care taken for unsecured loans, focusing on creditworthiness and repayment capacity.
    *   **ECL Model:** Uses PD, EAD, and LGD. Historical info used for PD; for certain pools, external agency data considered. LGD for gold loans is 9.96% (FY24), reflecting high collateral recoverability. For unsecured personal loans, LGD is 100%. For corporate loans, LGD is 65%.
*   **Liquidity Risk:** Managed by ALCO and ALM Committee. Focus on diversified funding sources (banks, FIs, capital markets) and maintaining a mix of short-term and long-term borrowings. LCR maintained as per RBI norms (226% for Q4 FY24, against requirement of 85%).
*   **Market Risk:**
    *   **Interest Rate Risk:** Mitigated by borrowing at competitive rates, diversified borrowings, and different tenors. Majority of borrowings are fixed rate; floating rate borrowings pose risk. Interest Rate Swaps used for hedging. A 1% increase in interest rates on floating rate borrowings would impact PBT by ₹3,074.36 million (FY24).
    *   **Price Risk (Gold):** Mitigated by LTV margins (minimum 25%), valuing only gold content, and sentimental value. Sustained decrease in gold prices could impact loan portfolio size and interest income.
    *   **Equity Price Risk:** Exposure from FVTPL and FVOCI equity securities. A 10% change in equity prices would impact PBT by ₹23.24 million and OCI by ₹225.16 million (FY24).
    *   **Foreign Currency Risk:** Arises from foreign currency borrowings (USD). Fully hedged using forward contracts and cross-currency swaps, minimizing sensitivity to exchange rate changes. No outstanding ECB as of March 31, 2024 (Standalone).
*   **Operational Risk:** Managed through control frameworks, segregation of duties, internal audits, staff education, and technology (AI-enabled security, AML software). Seven-layer security transformation plan. Frauds by employees/customers amounted to ₹50.65 million (standalone) and ₹56.38 million (consolidated) in FY24, which were recovered/written off/provided for.
*   **Regulatory Landscape:** Company identified as NBFC-Upper Layer under RBI's Scale Based Regulation, requiring appointment of specific control functionaries (CRO, CCO, Head of Internal Audit, CISO). Adherence to RBI guidelines is crucial.

### ESG Initiatives and Metrics

*   **Governance:**
    *   Board-level ESG committee oversees policies, practices, and performance.
    *   Adherence to NGRBC Principles. BRSR report with limited assurance provided.
    *   Policies: Code of Conduct, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, Whistle-Blower, Stakeholder Engagement, Sustainable Sourcing, Diversity & Inclusion.
*   **Environmental Initiatives:**
    *   **Renewable Energy:** Owns three windmills in Tamil Nadu (3.75 MW capacity, generating ~8 million units annually). Plans to increase investment in renewables. Aim for 100% renewable energy in owned office buildings by 2030.
    *   **Energy Efficiency:** Switching to LED lighting, LED glow signboards. Using inverters instead of diesel generators.
    *   **Water Management:** Aim to integrate water-efficient technologies by 2025.
    *   **Waste Management:** Limited impact due to NBFC operations, but ensures minimum waste generation.
    *   **Other:** Support for lake restoration, afforestation. Installed a 25 KWp solar plant at Kerala Museum.
*   **Social Initiatives (CSR & HR):**
    *   **CSR Expenditure (Standalone MFL):** ₹1,002.53 million spent in FY24 against a requirement of ₹998.49 million. Excess of ₹4.04 million carried forward.
    *   **CSR Expenditure (Group):** ₹1,036.51 million spent in FY24 against a requirement of ₹1,030

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Net cash used in operating activities was INR (93,089.57) million, a significant increase in usage compared to INR (19,110.94) million in FY23. This was primarily driven by a substantial increase in loans disbursed (INR (1,29,069.51) million adjustment) despite higher operating profit before working capital changes (INR 1,00,336.72 million). Finance costs paid were INR (49,866.22) million and income tax paid was INR (14,584.31) million.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash used in investing activities was INR (7,014.25) million. Key components include purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) & intangible assets of INR (1,067.58) million, and investment in equity shares of subsidiary amounting to INR (7,530.00) million, partially offset by interest received on investments (INR 2,496.28 million).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF_Financing):** Net cash from financing activities was INR 86,610.52 million. This was driven by proceeds from debt securities (INR 26,116.82 million) and borrowings (other than debt securities) (INR 69,120.78 million), offset by dividend payments (INR (8,027.08) million).
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF_Operational):** OCF (INR (93,089.57) million) - Capex (INR (1,067.58) million) = INR (94,157.15) million.

#### Consolidated Operations:

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Net cash used in operating activities was INR (1,37,233.97) million, a substantial increase in usage from INR (28,441.06) million in FY23. This was largely due to a significant increase in loans (INR (1,79,097.38) million adjustment), despite a higher operating profit before working capital changes (INR 1,16,075.93 million). Finance costs paid were INR (57,288.58) million and income tax paid was INR (16,106.56) million.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash from investing activities was INR 11.13 million. Major activities included purchase of PPE & intangible assets (INR (2,005.70) million) and investment in security receipts (INR (1,058.89) million), offset by proceeds from investment in mutual funds (INR 1,082.95 million) and interest received on investments (INR 3,107.06 million).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF_Financing):** Net cash from financing activities was INR 1,19,741.08 million. Key contributors were proceeds from debt securities (INR 28,073.83 million), borrowings (other than debt securities) (INR 99,051.94 million), and deposits (INR 1,072.70 million), partially offset by dividend payments (INR (8,027.08) million).
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF_Operational):** OCF (INR (1,37,233.97) million) - Capex (INR (2,005.70) million) = INR (1,39,239.67) million.

The significant cash outflow in operating activities for both standalone and consolidated figures reflects the core business activity of increased lending.
