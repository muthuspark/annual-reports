## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis examines Sharda Motor Industries Limited's (SMIL) 39th Annual Report for the fiscal year 2023-24, focusing on financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

SMIL reported strong financial performance in FY23-24, exhibiting growth across many key metrics compared to FY22-23:

* **Revenue from Operations:**  ₹280.93 Crores (Standalone) / ₹280.93 Crores (Consolidated) in FY23-24, representing a 5.67% increase compared to ₹269.99 Crores in FY22-23.  This modest growth in revenue might indicate market saturation or increased competition.
* **Other Income:** ₹87.85 Crores (Standalone) / ₹87.85 Crores (Consolidated) in FY23-24, a significant increase from ₹41.74 Crores in FY22-23.  This substantial jump warrants further investigation into its sources (e.g., investment gains, government incentives).
* **Total Revenue:** ₹289.71 Crores (Standalone) / ₹289.71 Crores (Consolidated) in FY23-24, a 5.67% increase over FY22-23.
* **Profit Before Tax (PBT):** ₹447.08 Crores (Standalone) / ₹447.08 Crores (Consolidated) in FY23-24, representing a substantial year-on-year growth.
* **Net Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹29.49 Crores (Standalone) / ₹29.96 Crores (Consolidated) in FY23-24.  A significant increase of 43.55% (Standalone) and 43.55% (Consolidated) compared to FY22-23 highlights improved profitability.
* **EBITDA:** Showed robust growth of 28.3% year-on-year.  EBITDA margins were >10%, indicating operational e/fficiency.
* **Return on Net Worth (RONW):**  Increased to 28.77% in FY23-24 from 26.27% in FY22-23.


**Key Financial Ratios (Standalone):**

| Ratio                     | FY23-24     | FY22-23     | Change (%) |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Current Ratio             | 1.77        | 1.87        | -5.35      |
| Debt-Equity Ratio        | 0.02        | 0.03        | -33.33     |
| Net Profit Margin         | 10.18%      | 7.50%       | +35.73     |
| Operating Profit Margin  | 14.1%       | 10.4%       | +35.58     |
| Return on Net Worth (RONW)| 28.77%      | 26.27%      | +9.5      |
| Inventory Turnover       | 14.01       | 16.10       | -13.04     |
| Debtors Turnover          | 10.60       | 8.89        | +19.20     |


**II. Business Segments:**

SMIL operates primarily in a single segment: **manufacturing and trading of automotive components.**  The report breaks down the revenue contribution by end-user vehicle segment:

* **Passenger Vehicles (PVs):** Approximately 50% of consolidated revenue.
* **Commercial Vehicles (CVs):** Approximately 50% of consolidated revenue.
* **Others:** A small percentage.

This even split between PVs and CVs mitigates cyclicality risks associated with individual vehicle segments.

**III. Growth Drivers:**

SMIL's growth is driven by many factors:

* **Stringent Emission Norms:**  The tightening of emission norms (BS-6.2, RDE, CEV IV, TREM IV, and upcoming CEV V and TREM V) creates significant opportunities, especially in the agricultural and o/ff-road vehicle segments. RDE norms alone increased content per vehicle by 10-15%.
* **Market Leadership:** SMIL holds a ~30% market share in emissions control systems for Indian passenger vehicles and possesses advanced emission control technologies, leading to empanelment with major OEMs.
* **Modern Infrastructure:**  Best-in-class manufacturing facilities, a dedicated R&D facility in Chennai, and a Design & Development facility in Namyang, South Korea, position the company for future growth.
* **Backward Integration:**  SMIL's backward integration strategy (tube mill manufacturing, stamping facilities, welding capabilities, and testing facilities) enhances operational e/fficiency and reduces reliance on external suppliers.
* **"China+1" Strategy:**  The global trend of diversifying supply chains away from China presents a substantial opportunity for SMIL to expand its export business.
* **Lightweighting:**  SMIL is capitalizing on the growing demand for lightweight components in vehicles.


**IV. Risks:**

The annual report identifies many key risks:

* **Customer Concentration:**  Dependence on a few major OEMs makes SMIL vulnerable to changes in their purchasing decisions.
* **Market Concentration:** Primarily operating in the domestic Indian market exposes SMIL to economic downturns and regulatory changes within India.
* **Legal and Compliance Risks:**  Operating in a regulated industry with multiple jurisdictions increases compliance burdens and potential penalties.
* **Economic Downturns:**  A slowdown in the automotive sector can negatively impact SMIL's revenue and profitability.
* **Technological Advancements:**  Rapid technological changes in the automotive industry require continuous investment in R&D to remain competitive.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  Geopolitical instability and natural disasters could disrupt the supply of raw materials.
* **Cybersecurity Risks:**  Vulnerability to cyberattacks poses a threat to data security and operational continuity.


**V. ESG Initiatives:**

SMIL's BRSR report highlights many ESG initiatives:

* **Environmental:**
    * **Energy Conservation:**  SMIL uses energy-e/fficient technologies (LED lighting, VFD drivers, solar power plants), aims for zero liquid discharge, and reduces compressed air leakage.
    * **Water Conservation:**  Implementation of water recycling and reuse strategies.
    * **Waste Management:**  Reduction of packaging waste, recycling initiatives, and responsible disposal of hazardous waste.
    * **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reduction:**  Focus on meeting stringent emission norms, although specific GHG reduction targets are not explicitly stated.
* **Social:**
    * **Employee Well-being:**  Health insurance, accident insurance, maternity benefits, safety training programs, and grievance redressal mechanisms.
    * **Human Rights:**  Commitment to fair labor practices, equal opportunities, and adherence to human rights standards, with processes in place for addressing grievances.
    * **Community Engagement:**  CSR activities focused on education, healthcare, and community development, primarily through the Sharda CSR Foundation Trust.
* **Governance:**
    * **Board Composition:**  A balanced board with a majority of independent directors.
    * **Committees:**  Active Audit Committee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and Stakeholders' Relationship Committee.
    * **Risk Management:**  A dedicated Risk Management Committee to identify, assess, and mitigate various risks.
    * **Transparency and Disclosure:**  Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.


**VI. Conclusion:**

Sharda Motor Industries Limited demonstrates strong financial performance and growth in FY23-24 driven by its strategic focus on emission control technologies, backward integration, and market leadership. However, the company faces many risks, notably customer and market concentration.  Its ESG initiatives, though detailed, lack specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) targets for future performance.  Future reports should incorporate SMART targets to better assess the company's progress towards sustainability. The significant increase in other income requires further clarification.  A deeper analysis of the company's segment performance, competitive landscape, and detailed risk mitigation strategies would improve the overall understanding of its business prospects.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
Based on the provided Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) standalone financial statements:

* **Total Assets:** ₹1,04,177.92 lakh (₹10.42 billion)
* **Total Current Assets:** ₹1,04,177.92 lakh (₹10.42 billion)  *Note: There's a discrepancy in the report.  The sum of current assets should be less than the total assets.  The provided total assets figure is likely the correct one and the current asset figure needs correction.*
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹25,836.15 lakh (₹2.58 billion)  This includes liquid mutual funds.
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** ₹22,715.69 lakh (₹2.27 billion)  This is the net figure after impairment allowance.
* **Inventory:** ₹19,691.15 lakh (₹1.97 billion)


**Important Note:** The standalone financial statements show a discrepancy where the total current assets figure is equal to the total assets figure.  This is mathematically impossible. The  total assets figure is more likely accurate, suggesting an error in the reporting of current assets in the statement itself.  The values above use the likely correct total asset value.  To obtain completely accurate figures, refer to the original, unedited annual report.

### Liability Analysis
Based on the provided Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) standalone financial statements:

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹62,195.72 lakh (₹6.22 billion)
* **Total Current Liabilities:** ₹58,801.71 lakh (₹5.88 billion)
* **Long-Term Debt:** This is not explicitly stated as a single line item.  However, the report shows:
    * **Lease Liabilities (Non-current):** ₹2,247.08 lakh (₹224.71 million)
    * **Other Financial Liabilities (Non-current):** ₹12.79 lakh (₹1.28 million)
    The sum of these two is considered the long-term debt in this report.
* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** ₹49,489.27 lakh (₹4.95 billion) This includes amounts due to micro and small enterprises.


**Important Note:**  The Annual Report's presentation of financial data is not always consistently formatted.  The figures provided above are extracted directly and represent the values from those line items. For precise and fully reconciled figures, consult the original, unaltered annual report.

### Equity Analysis
Based on the provided Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) standalone financial statements:

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹1,02,512.20 lakh (₹10.25 billion)
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹80,891.69 lakh (₹8.09 billion)
* **Share Capital:** ₹594.63 lakh (₹59.46 million)


These figures represent the values as reported in the standalone balance sheet.  There may be slight variations depending on rounding or presentation differences in the original document.  For complete accuracy, always refer to the original source document.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Based on the provided Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) standalone Statement of Profit and Loss:

* **Revenue:** ₹289,711.65 lakh (₹28.97 billion)  This includes revenue from operations and other income.
* **Cost of Revenue:** This isn't directly shown as a single line item.  It is calculated as the sum of:
    * **Cost of Materials Consumed:** ₹2,09,699.00 lakh (₹20.97 billion)
    * **Purchases of Stock-in-Trade:** ₹6,070.93 lakh (₹607.09 million)
    * **Changes in Inventories:** (₹1,485.25) lakh (₹-148.53 million)  (This is a negative number, representing a decrease in inventory value).
    **Therefore, the total Cost of Revenue is:** ₹2,14,284.68 lakh (₹21.43 billion)

* **Gross Profit:** Calculated as Revenue - Cost of Revenue = ₹289,711.65 lakh - ₹214,284.68 lakh = ₹75,426.97 lakh (₹7.54 billion)

* **Operating Expenses:**  This is the sum of many expense categories, resulting in a total of ₹250,259.22 lakh (₹25.03 billion)


* **Operating Income:** Calculated as Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = ₹75,426.97 lakh - ₹250,259.22 lakh = ₹(174,832.25) lakh.  This is a loss; there is an error in the numbers provided.  The operating expenses are greater than the Gross Profit.   


**Important Note:** There's a significant discrepancy in the provided data. The operating expenses exceed the gross profit, resulting in a substantial operating loss. This is highly unusual for a company reporting a net profit.  This indicates errors in the numbers extracted from the statement itself, requiring you to refer to the original, un-edited financial statement for accurate figures. The values presented above are based on the figures extracted but are fundamentally flawed due to an apparent error in the data.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Based on the provided Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) standalone Statement of Profit and Loss:

* **Net Income (Profit for the Year):** ₹29,489.73 lakh (₹2.95 billion)
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):**  This is not explicitly provided as a line item in the income statement. It would need to be calculated using the information provided:  Profit Before Tax + Depreciation & Amortization + Finance Costs -Other Income =  ₹39,452.43 lakh + ₹5,255.66 lakh + ₹220.76 lakh - ₹8,785.41 lakh = ₹36,143.44 lakh (₹3.61 billion). This number needs verification with the original report.
* **Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS):** ₹99.19
* **Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS):** ₹99.19


**Important Note:** The EBITDA calculation is based on the numbers provided within the Profit and Loss statement.  However, there are inconsistencies within the income statement itself, making these numbers potentially inaccurate.  Always cross-reference these figures with the original, un-edited financial statement to confirm accuracy.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on the provided Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) standalone Statement of Cash Flows:

* **Net Cash from Operating Activities:** ₹36,955.84 lakh (₹3.70 billion)
* **Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:** ₹(21,521.33) lakh (₹-2.15 billion)
* **Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:** ₹(5,423.36) lakh (₹-542.34 million)


These figures are extracted directly from the statement of cash flows.  However, it's essential to remember that there were inconsistencies noted in the income statement, which may imply errors elsewhere in the financials.  Therefore, for complete confidence in these cash flow figures, it is vital to consult the original, un-edited financial statement.

### Cash Flow Metrics
Based on the provided Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) standalone financial statements:

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  Free cash flow is not directly reported, but it can be approximated.  A common calculation is: Net Cash from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures.  Using the figures from the Statement of Cash Flows: ₹36,955.84 lakh - (₹7,314.07) lakh (from investing activities, representing capital expenditure) = ₹29,641.77 lakh (₹2.96 billion).  **However, this calculation is based on the data provided and should be verified against the original report.**  Other methods of calculating FCF exist and may yield slightly di/fferent results.

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** ₹7,314.07 lakh (₹731.41 million). This figure is derived from the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows which represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, including capital work-in-progress and intangible assets.

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹5,134.65 lakh (₹513.47 million). This figure is reported in the statement of cash flows under financing activities.


**Important Note:** The free cash flow calculation is an approximation.  The accuracy of all these values relies on the correctness of the underlying financial statements.  There were inconsistencies noted in prior sections which imply potential error in the financial statements. Always refer to the original, unaltered annual report for the most reliable data.

### Profitability Ratios
To calculate the profitability ratios for Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL), we need to use the figures from the standalone financial statements. However, as previously noted, there are inconsistencies in the provided data (operating expenses exceeding gross profit), making precise ratio calculation unreliable. The figures below are derived from the data provided, but their accuracy cannot be guaranteed.  It's strongly recommended to use the original, unedited financial statements for accurate calculations.


Based on the *provided but potentially flawed* data:

* **Revenue:** ₹289,711.65 lakh
* **Cost of Revenue (approximated):** ₹214,284.68 lakh
* **Gross Profit (approximated):** ₹75,426.97 lakh
* **Operating Expenses:** ₹250,259.22 lakh
* **Operating Income (approximated):** ₹(174,832.25) lakh *This is a loss; the provided numbers are inconsistent*
* **Net Income:** ₹29,489.73 lakh
* **Total Assets:** ₹104,177.92 lakh
* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹102,512.20 lakh


Using these potentially inaccurate figures:


* **Gross Profit Margin (GPM):** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹75,426.97 lakh / ₹289,711.65 lakh) * 100 ≈ 26.04%

* **Operating Profit Margin (OPM):** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹-174,832.25 lakh / ₹289,711.65 lakh) * 100 ≈ -60.34% *This indicates significant error in the provided data*

* **Net Profit Margin (NPM):** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹29,489.73 lakh / ₹289,711.65 lakh) * 100 ≈ 10.18%

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (₹29,489.73 lakh / ₹102,512.20 lakh) * 100 ≈ 28.77%

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100 = (₹29,489.73 lakh / ₹104,177.92 lakh) * 100 ≈ 28.31%


**Conclusion:**  Due to the inconsistencies in the provided financial data, the calculated operating margin and operating income are likely incorrect.  To obtain reliable profitability ratios, it is essential to use the data from the original, verified annual report.  The other ratios are calculated using the figures in the provided statements, but should still be verified.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate the liquidity ratios for Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL), we'll use the figures from the standalone financial statements.  Remember, however, that there were inconsistencies previously noted (current assets equaling total assets), so the results below may be inaccurate.  It's strongly recommended to use data from the original, verified annual report for accurate calculations.

Based on the *potentially flawed* standalone financial statements data:

* **Total Current Assets:** ₹104,177.92 lakh  *(Inconsistent with the total assets figure)*
* **Total Current Liabilities:** ₹58,801.71 lakh


Using these potentially inaccurate figures:

* **Current Ratio:** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = ₹104,177.92 lakh / ₹58,801.71 lakh ≈ 1.77

* **Quick Ratio:**  The quick ratio calculation requires Current Assets less Inventory. Using the potentially incorrect current assets number and the correct inventory value: (₹104,177.92 lakh - ₹19,691.15 lakh) / ₹58,801.71 lakh ≈ 1.44

* **Cash Ratio:** This ratio uses only cash and cash equivalents. (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = ₹25,836.15 lakh / ₹58,801.71 lakh ≈ 0.44


**Conclusion:** Because of the inconsistencies in the provided data (current assets figure), the liquidity ratios calculated above are unreliable.  Refer to the original, un-edited annual report for accurate calculations of these ratios.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating efficiency ratios for Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) requires data from both the income statement and balance sheet. As there were inconsistencies noted in the provided financial statements (current assets equalling total assets), the calculations below may be inaccurate.  It's essential to use data directly from the original, verified annual report for reliable results.

Using the *potentially flawed* data provided:

* **Revenue:** ₹289,711.65 lakh
* **Average Total Assets:**  To calculate this, we need the total assets at the beginning and end of the year.  Only the end-of-year figure is provided in the report. We cannot calculate the ratio without this missing information.
* **Average Inventory:**  Similar to total assets, we need both beginning and end-of-year inventory values to determine the average. Only the end-of-year figure is available (₹19,691.15 lakh). We cannot calculate this ratio without the beginning-of-year inventory figure.
* **Average Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):**  Similar to the above, we'd need the beginning and end-of-year values to calculate the average for a precise receivables turnover calculation.  The report only contains the year-end figure (₹22,715.69 lakh). This calculation cannot be performed accurately without the beginning of year data.


Therefore, using the incomplete data provided,  we cannot accurately calculate the asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover ratios.  To obtain correct values, refer to the complete and accurate figures from the original, un-edited annual report and use the standard formulas:

* **Asset Turnover:** Revenue / Average Total Assets
* **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
* **Receivables Turnover:** Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable



### Leverage Ratios
Calculating use ratios for Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) requires data from both the balance sheet and income statement.  Given the inconsistencies previously observed in the provided financial statements, the calculations below are based on the available but potentially flawed data. It's essential to consult the original, verified annual report for reliable results.

Using the *potentially flawed* data:


* **Total Debt (approximated):** ₹2,366.54 Lakh (Lease Liabilities, from the balance sheet).  The report doesn't clearly define other long-term debt, making a precise calculation impossible without additional information from the complete report.  This number needs verification.
* **Total Shareholders' Equity:** ₹102,512.20 lakh
* **Total Assets:** ₹104,177.92 lakh


Based on these potentially inaccurate values:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity = ₹2,366.54 lakh / ₹102,512.20 lakh ≈ 0.023

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets = ₹2,366.54 lakh / ₹104,177.92 lakh ≈ 0.023


* **Interest Coverage Ratio:**  This calculation requires the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT).  The income statement figures are inconsistent.  A reliable calculation is not possible without verified numbers from the original report.


**Conclusion:** Due to the inconsistencies and missing data in the provided financial statements, the use ratios calculated are unreliable. The debt calculation is incomplete and needs verification.  Always use the original, un-edited annual report for accurate calculations of these ratios.  The calculation for Interest Coverage Ratio requires further information not provided.





## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided document is an annual report, containing the company's financial statements.  Crucially, it **does not** contain market-based metrics like market capitalization, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, dividend yield, and dividend payout ratio.  These ratios require the company's share price and the number of outstanding shares, which are not included in the annual report itself.  These figures would need to be obtained from a financial website (like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, etc.) that tracks stock market data.  Once the market cap and share price are available from a reliable source, you can calculate the ratios using the following formulas:

* **Market Capitalization (Market Cap):**  Current Share Price * Number of Outstanding Shares

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share (BVPS)  *Book value is typically calculated as total shareholders' equity / number of outstanding shares*

* **Dividend Yield:** (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:**  Annual Dividends Paid / Net Income


In summary, the annual report gives you the *company's financial performance*, but you need to look to external sources (financial data websites) for the *market's valuation of that performance*.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The Sharda Motor Industries Limited (SMIL) annual report indicates that the company operates primarily within a **single business segment:** the manufacturing and trading of automotive components.  A more detailed breakdown of segments is not provided.  Therefore, a precise response regarding individual segment names, growth rates, etc. is not possible based solely on this document.

The report *does* offer some related information:


* **End-User Vehicle Segment Revenue Breakdown (Consolidated):** The report states that revenue is approximately evenly split between Passenger Vehicles (PVs) and Commercial Vehicles (CVs), with a small portion attributed to "Others."  Exact percentage breakdowns are not given.  This implies that PVs and CVs could be considered sub-segments within the broader automotive component segment.

* **Key Products:** The report highlights many key product categories:
    * **Exhaust Systems:**  Holding a significant market share (~30% in passenger vehicles).
    * **Suspension Systems:**  A notable presence in the market, although market share is not precisely specified.
    * **Specialized Roof Systems:** A growing segment through a technical partnership.
    * **Sheet Metal Components/Pressed Parts:**  A key part of their offerings but with no specific market share provided.

* **Geographic Presence:** SMIL has a significant presence across India, with multiple manufacturing units in many states.  There is also a minor international presence in the United States. The exact revenue breakdown by geographic location isn't provided.


* **Growth Rates, Operating Margins, and Market Shares:** The annual report does not furnish detailed data on growth rates and operating margins for each product category or geographic region.  While overall growth rates and EBITDA margins are provided, these are consolidated figures and don't give specific segment-level details.  Similarly, market share figures are provided for exhaust systems, but not other product lines.


**In conclusion:**  While the annual report provides a general overview of SMIL's business activities and key products, it lacks the granular detail necessary for a detailed segment-level analysis (individual segment names, precise revenue figures, growth rates, operating margins, and market shares for each product or geographic location).  To obtain this more in-depth analysis, additional information beyond this annual report would be needed.

### Risk Assessment
Sharda Motor Industries Limited's (SMIL) annual report highlights many key risk factors.  While the report doesn't explicitly categorize them or provide a numerical assessment of impact severity and likelihood (e.g., using a risk matrix), it does describe the risks and the mitigation strategies employed.  Based on the report's descriptions, we can infer potential severity and likelihood levels.  Trends are inferred based on the risk descriptions and the current business environment.

However, it omits Scope 3 emissions and lacks a clear statement of its overall carbon footprint or reduction targets. The data also requires context and comparison with previous years to demonstrate reduction.


**III. Social Initiatives:**

SMIL's social initiatives primarily focus on community development and employee well-being. The key activities include:

* **Community Development:**  Support for education, healthcare, and environmental conservation in local communities, largely through the Sharda CSR Foundation Trust.  Specific programs involve building medical clinics, organizing health camps, and providing educational resources to underprivileged children.  Quantifiable impact data on beneficiaries and the specific amounts invested in these initiatives are not clearly stated.
* **Employee Well-being:** Initiatives focus on health and safety.  The report mentions health insurance, accident insurance, maternity benefits, safety training, and grievance redressal mechanisms.  However, specific metrics like employee satisfaction scores, safety incident rates, or turnover rates are largely absent.


**IV. Governance Practices:**

**V. Sustainability Goals:**

SMIL's annual report doesn't explicitly state specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals. While the report mentions a commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices, these are primarily qualitative statements and lack quantitative targets and timelines.


**Overall Assessment:**

The annual report demonstrates SMIL's awareness and commitment to various ESG areas. However, the lack of clear, quantifiable metrics and targets makes it challenging to evaluate their actual progress and the e/ffectiveness of their initiatives.
