## Peninsula Land Limited: Financial Analysis (FY 2023-24)

### 3-Year Financial Trend Analysis (FY22-FY24)

#### Revenue & Profitability

##### Consolidated Revenue

Consolidated revenue exhibits significant volatility. FY23 recorded high revenue (₹1,039 Cr), likely driven by major project completions/revenue recognition, followed by a decrease in FY24 (₹582 Cr). FY22 appears lower than both subsequent years based on chart trends.

##### Consolidated PAT (Profit After Tax)

Consolidated PAT demonstrates a strong positive turnaround trend. From apparent losses or lower profits in FY22, PAT increased significantly in FY23 (₹97 Cr) and further improved in FY24 (₹129 Cr), indicating enhanced profitability despite lower FY24 revenue. This suggests margin improvement or positive impacts from exceptional items/cost management.

##### Standalone Revenue & PAT

Standalone Revenue & PAT follow a similar pattern to consolidated figures, with FY23 revenue (₹1,002 Cr) higher than FY24 (₹528 Cr).

## Peninsula Land Limited: Financial Analysis Report (FY 2023-24)

### Revenue Analysis

*   **Overall Performance:** Peninsula Land Limited reported a significant decrease in revenue from operations for FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2022-23 on both a standalone and consolidated basis.
    *   **Standalone Revenue:** Decreased by 47.3% YoY to ₹527.87 Cr from ₹1,002.12 Cr.
    *   **Consolidated Revenue:** Decreased by 43.9% YoY to ₹582.05 Cr from ₹1,038.92 Cr.
*   **Revenue Mix (Standalone - Note 39):**
    *   Realty Sales: ₹468.58 Cr (FY24) vs. ₹909.85 Cr (FY23) - Primary driver of the overall revenue decline.
    *   Rental Income: ₹38.98 Cr (FY24) vs. ₹37.24 Cr (FY23) - Slight increase.
    *   Other Operating Income: ₹20.31 Cr (FY24) vs. ₹55.03 Cr (FY23) - Significant decrease.
*   **Segment/Geography:** The company operates primarily in the real estate development segment within India (Notes 54 & 57). No further geographic or sub-segment breakdown is provided in the report for detailed growth analysis beyond the type of operating income. The significant YoY decline suggests timing differences in project completions and revenue recognition under Ind AS 115, potentially with fewer large projects reaching the recognition threshold in FY24 compared to FY23. Note 63 (Standalone) and Note 68 (Consolidated) mention recognition of ₹19.28 Cr from residual area sales of prior completed projects. Note 66 mentions commencement of revenue recognition for plotted development projects.

### Cost Structure Analysis

*   **Cost of Realty Sales:** This remains the largest cost component.
    *   **Standalone:** Decreased to ₹335.28 Cr (63.5% of Revenue) in FY24 from ₹820.53 Cr (81.9% of Revenue) in FY23. The decrease in absolute terms is due to lower revenue, while the decrease as a percentage of revenue suggests a potentially more profitable mix of projects recognized or effective cost management on recognized projects in FY24. Note 46 shows this cost comprises Realty Cost Incurred (₹106.00 Cr) and Changes in Inventory (₹231.29 Cr).
    *   **Consolidated:** Decreased to ₹369.43 Cr (63.5% of Revenue) in FY24 from ₹818.14 Cr (78.8% of Revenue) in FY23. Similar trend to standalone. Note 45 shows this cost comprises Realty Cost Incurred (₹107.68 Cr) and Changes in Inventory (₹261.75 Cr).
*   **Finance Costs:**
    *   **Standalone:** Decreased to ₹33.80 Cr (6.4% of Revenue) in FY24 from ₹52.66 Cr (5.3% of Revenue) in FY23. While absolute costs decreased due to debt reduction efforts, the cost as a percentage of revenue increased due to the sharper fall in revenue.
    *   **Consolidated:** Decreased to ₹39.66 Cr (6.8% of Revenue) in FY24 from ₹62.92 Cr (6.1% of Revenue) in FY23. Similar trend to standalone.
*   **Employee Benefits Expense:** Relatively stable in absolute terms but increased as a percentage of revenue due to the revenue decline.
    *   **Standalone:** ₹19.28 Cr (3.7% of Revenue) in FY24 vs. ₹17.84 Cr (1.8% of Revenue) in FY23.
    *   **Consolidated:** ₹19.42 Cr (3.3% of Revenue) in FY24 vs. ₹18.09 Cr (1.7% of Revenue) in FY23.
*   **Other Expenses:**
    *   **Standalone:** Increased to ₹59.48 Cr (11.3% of Revenue) in FY24 from ₹47.90 Cr (4.8% of Revenue) in FY23. Note 36 indicates major components include Brokerage & Commission (₹10.58 Cr) and Legal & Professional Fees (₹16.32 Cr). The increase appears driven partly by higher brokerage/commission relative to lower sales revenue and significant write-offs/provisions related to subsidiary loans offset by reversals.
    *   **Consolidated:** Increased slightly to ₹59.85 Cr (10.3% of Revenue) in FY24 from ₹56.19 Cr (5.4% of Revenue) in FY23.

### Margin Analysis

*   **Gross Margin (Revenue - Cost of Realty Sales):**
    *   **Standalone:** Improved significantly to 36.5% in FY24 from 18.1% in FY23.
    *   **Consolidated:** Improved significantly to 36.5% in FY24 from 21.2% in FY23. The improvement suggests better profitability on projects recognized during FY24 or lower write-downs compared to FY23.
*   **Operating Margin (PBEIT / Revenue):**
    *   **Standalone:** Increased to 14.4% in FY24 from 6.3% in FY23.
    *   **Consolidated (PBT before Exceptional Items & Share of Assoc/JV / Revenue):** Increased to 16.0% in FY24 from 8.0% in FY23.
    The improvement in operating margins, despite lower revenue, stems primarily from the significantly better gross margins achieved in FY24.
*   **Net Margin (PAT / Revenue):**
    *   **Standalone:** Increased substantially to 17.8% in FY24 from 5.0% in FY23.
    *   **Consolidated (PAT attributable to equity holders / Revenue):** Increased substantially to 22.0% in FY24 from 9.4% in FY23.
    The significant improvement in net margins is driven by better gross and operating margins, coupled with positive exceptional items (gain on debt settlement, reversals) compared to negative exceptional items (provisions) in the prior year.

### Operating Leverage

*   The company exhibits operating leverage, typical of the real estate sector with significant fixed costs related to project overheads, employee benefits, and administrative expenses relative to project-specific variable costs.
*   **Standalone:** Revenue decreased by 47.3%, while Operating Profit (PBEIT) increased by 21.4% (from ₹63.47 Cr to ₹77.05 Cr). This indicates a positive impact from improved gross margins and controlled operating expenses outweighing the revenue decline, leading to a negative DOL calculation which suggests factors beyond typical operating leverage (like margin mix or cost structure changes) are dominant.
*   **Consolidated:** Revenue decreased by 43.9%, while Operating Profit (PBT before Exceptional Items & Share of Assoc/JV) increased by 12.8% (from ₹83.28 Cr to ₹93.96 Cr). Similar to standalone, improved gross margins buffered the impact of revenue decline on operating profit.

### Non-recurring / Exceptional Items

*   Exceptional items significantly impacted profitability in both years.
*   **Standalone (Note 56):** Net gain of ₹17.21 Cr in FY24 vs. a net loss of ₹10.42 Cr in FY23.
    *   FY24: Driven by Gain on debt settlement (₹24.37 Cr) and Reversal of financial guarantee obligation (₹41.44 Cr), offset by Impairment of loans to subsidiaries/associates/JVs (-₹39.60 Cr).
    *   FY23: Driven primarily by Provisions for financial guarantee obligation (-₹17.07 Cr) and Impairment of loans (-₹29.12 Cr).
*   **Consolidated (Note 48):** Net gain of ₹37.31 Cr in FY24 vs. a net gain of ₹16.64 Cr in FY23.
    *   FY24: Driven by Gain on debt settlement (₹54.42 Cr), offset partly by Impairment of loans/investments (-₹21.85 Cr).
    *   FY23: Driven by Gain on debt settlement (₹24.37 Cr), offset by Provision for financial guarantee obligation (-₹17.07 Cr).

### EPS Analysis

*   **Standalone (Note 44):**
    *   Basic EPS: Increased to ₹3.13 in FY24 from ₹1.80 in FY23.
    *   Diluted EPS: Increased to ₹3.10 in FY24 from ₹1.80 in FY23.
*   **Consolidated (Note 43):**
    *   Basic EPS: Increased to ₹4.29 in FY24 from ₹3.49 in FY23.
    *   Diluted EPS: Increased to ₹4.26 in FY24 from ₹3.49 in FY23.
*   The increase in EPS is primarily driven by the significant rise in Net Profit After Tax, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of shares due to the preferential allotment of equity shares during the year. The issuance of Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs) also impacts the diluted EPS calculation in FY24.

## Financial Analysis: Peninsula Land Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Cash Flow Analysis (Standalone)

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Net cash generated from operations stood at ₹16,379 lakhs (FY23: ₹25,258 lakhs). The decrease is primarily driven by a smaller positive change in inventories (₹24,027 lakhs vs ₹64,754 lakhs in FY23) and a larger negative impact from trade and other payables (-₹22,027 lakhs vs -₹10,146 lakhs). Profit before tax was higher at ₹9,118 lakhs (FY23: ₹5,030 lakhs), but working capital changes significantly impacted OCF. Notable non-cash adjustments include provision for impairment reversal (₹-7,917 lakhs), gain on debt settlement (₹-2,341 lakhs), and finance costs (₹3,406 lakhs).
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash used in investing activities was ₹16,186 lakhs (FY23: used ₹14,567 lakhs). Major outflows included the purchase of current investments (₹16,115 lakhs). Key inflows were from interest received (₹518 lakhs) and proceeds from bank fixed deposits (₹2,437 lakhs). Capex (Purchase of PPE & intangible assets) was minimal at ₹19 lakhs (FY23: ₹14 lakhs).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Net cash flow from financing activities was ₹8,855 lakhs (FY23: used ₹6,343 lakhs). Significant inflows included the issuance of Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (₹3,400 lakhs), equity shares (₹6,600 lakhs), and proceeds from long-term bank loans (₹25,000 lakhs). Major outflows were repayment of long-term bank loans (₹22,188 lakhs), repayment of long-term intercorporate loans (₹9,434 lakhs), and finance charges paid (₹5,520 lakhs).

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Decreased by 15.63% compared to the previous year, indicating slower inventory movement. The ratio stood at 0.82x (Standalone).
*   **Trade Receivable Turnover Ratio:** Decreased by 48.81% compared to the previous year, suggesting slower collection of receivables. The ratio stood at 133.43x (Standalone), though this high absolute number likely reflects the nature of real estate sales recognition rather than typical turnover cycles. The report attributes the change to higher revenue recognition in the previous year and better collections relative to current year sales.
*   **Trade Payable Turnover Ratio:** Decreased by 39.15% compared to the previous year, indicating the company is taking longer to pay its suppliers. The ratio stood at 1.76x (Standalone). The report attributes this to project completions during the year.
*   **Overall:** The significant decreases across all three turnover ratios suggest a slowdown in the operating cycle and potentially less efficient working capital management compared to FY23, driven mainly by shifts in project completion and revenue recognition timing.

### Capex Analysis by Segment

*   The Company identifies Real Estate Development as its sole business segment (MD&A, page 100; Notes, page 178).
*   Standalone capital expenditure on Property, Plant, and Equipment & Intangible Assets was ₹19 lakhs in FY24 (FY23: ₹14 lakhs), indicating minimal investment in fixed assets during the year (Standalone Cash Flow Statement, page 80).

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividend:** No dividend was recommended for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, to conserve funds for business growth plans (Directors' Report, page 38). No dividend was declared in FY23, FY22, FY21, FY20, FY19, FY18, or FY17 (Corporate Governance Report, page 69).
*   **Share Buyback:** The report makes no mention of any share buyback activities during FY24 or preceding years covered.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** The Standalone DSCR decreased by 30.02% compared to the previous year, calculated at 1.39x (page 100). While still above 1, the decline suggests reduced capacity to service debt obligations from operating earnings compared to the prior year, influenced by lower OCF despite higher profits.
*   **Debt:** Standalone debt decreased significantly during the year, driven by repayments facilitated by operational cash flow, equity/CCD issuance, and new borrowings (Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement). The Debt-Equity ratio improved significantly, decreasing by 95.40% (page 100), reflecting deleveraging and equity strengthening.

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Liquidity Position:** The Standalone Current Ratio improved significantly by 61.20% to 1.77x (FY23: 1.10x) (page 100). This indicates an improved ability to meet short-term obligations, driven by a reduction in current liabilities (primarily borrowings) and an increase in current assets (mainly current investments).
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** The report does not explicitly state the CCC. However, based on the turnover ratios:
    *   Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) would have increased (lower turnover).
    *   Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) would have increased (lower turnover).
    *   Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) would have increased (lower turnover).
    The net effect suggests a lengthening of the cash conversion cycle compared to FY23, primarily due to slower inventory movement and receivables collection, although offset somewhat by extended payment terms to suppliers.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield Trends

*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
    *   Standalone FCF (OCF - Capex) for FY24 = ₹16,379 lakhs - ₹19 lakhs = ₹16,360 lakhs.
    *   Standalone FCF for FY23 = ₹25,258 lakhs - ₹14 lakhs = ₹25,244 lakhs.
    *   Standalone FCF decreased significantly in FY24 compared to FY23, mainly due to lower OCF resulting from working capital changes.
*   **FCF Yield:** Calculation of FCF Yield requires market capitalization data, which is not provided in the Annual Report. Therefore, FCF yield trends cannot be determined from the provided information. The trend shows a substantial decrease in standalone FCF generation year-over-year.

The outlook for FY 2024-25 is described as "very positive though cautious," anticipating accelerated growth over the next 2-3 years driven by new project additions (including new phases to existing projects) starting FY 2024-25. Continued focus on operational performance, project execution, financial prudence, sales, and collections is guided.
*   **Assumptions:** The guidance implicitly assumes:
    *   Sustained robust growth in the Indian real estate sector, particularly residential, redevelopment, and plotted segments.
    *   Continued favorable macroeconomic conditions (e.g., disposable income, stable interest rates albeit potentially easing).
    *   Successful deployment and execution of the RE JV Platform strategy.
    *   Availability and timely infusion of committed funds (equity, OCDs, JV capital).
    *   Ability to secure and execute new projects profitably both within and outside the JV platform.
    *   Maintaining operational efficiencies and quality standards.
    *   Stable regulatory environment (RERA, FSI, Taxation).
*   **Outlook (MD&A):** The company aims to capitalize on emerging opportunities, underpinned by a strong brand, recent performance improvements (profitability, low debt), and secured funding avenues (PE involvement, institutional funding).

### Market Environment & Growth Forecasts

*   **Overall Market:** The report cites strong real estate sector growth (>41% YoY in FY23-24) with projections of double-digit CAGR between 2024-2030. The sector size is expected to reach USD 1 trillion by 2030 and contribute significantly to India's GDP (13-15% by 2025-26). Key drivers identified include economic stability, investor confidence, rising disposable incomes, urbanization, government incentives (PMAY, AIF), and significant FDI inflows ($60.53B since Apr 2000).
*   **Residential Segment:** Record sales observed in FY23-24, particularly in top cities (Mumbai, Pune showing robust growth). Demand driven by end-users, preference for Grade A developers, larger homes, premium/luxury segments, and plotted developments. A significant urban housing shortage persists (~10M units + 25M affordable needed by 2030). Redevelopment in Mumbai presents substantial opportunities. Outlook suggests continued strong momentum in sales and new launches.
*   **Commercial Segment:** Steady growth noted, fueled by domestic demand, GCC expansion (projected 1,900 by 2025), data center stock doubling, and flexible/co-working space demand due to hybrid work models. Institutional investments are strong ($4.6B in FY24), favoring logistics, warehouses, and data centers. Outlook anticipates positive demand, strong leasing (especially tech), and recovery in REITs.
*   **Technology & Sustainability:** Increasing adoption of PropTech, AI, VR/AR is enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency. ESG practices and demand for green/sustainable buildings are rising priorities.

### Strategic Initiatives

*   **Peninsula 2.0 & Funding:** The core strategy involves leveraging the "Peninsula 2.0" platform. This is supported by:
    *   Successful equity raise of ₹100 Cr.
    *   Planned Optionally Convertible Debenture (OCD) issue of ₹150 Cr (Tranche A: ₹112.5 Cr, Tranche B: ₹37.5 Cr) via preferential allotment to Arsenio Strategies (Alpha Alternatives Group) in Q1 FY25.
    *   Establishment of a strategic RE JV Platform with Alpha Alternatives and Delta Corp. Total funding commitment up to ₹765 Cr (Alpha: ₹450 Cr, Peninsula: ₹225 Cr, Delta: ₹90 Cr).
*   **Development Management:** Peninsula Land will act as the exclusive Development Manager for the RE JV Platform entities, generating fee income.
*   **Segment Focus:** Strategic focus on high-IRR segments: redevelopment projects in Mumbai/MMR and plotted developments in Alibaug, Pune, Karjat via the JV Platform. The company will also pursue projects outside this platform.
*   **Operational Strategy:** Emphasis on customer centricity, digital transformation for efficiency, strengthening project management capabilities, and maintaining a high-performance culture.

### Capital Allocation & Expenditure Plans

*   **Capital Infusion:** Significant capital influx planned/secured: ₹100 Cr equity (raised), ₹150 Cr OCDs (planned), up to ₹225 Cr commitment to the RE JV Platform over time.
*   **Allocation Focus:** Capital is primarily directed towards funding new project acquisitions and development, specifically within the targeted redevelopment and plotted development segments, both through the JV platform and independently. Expenditure on project execution (land, construction, approvals, finance costs) constitutes the primary use of funds, treated largely as inventory cost under real estate accounting norms. Explicit CapEx budgets for fixed assets (like office equipment) are not detailed but are likely minimal compared to project development costs.

### Efficiency Improvement

*   Management commentary highlights a commitment to efficiency across operations:
    *   **Project Execution:** Focus on efficient planning, execution, and timely delivery.
    *   **Financial Management:** Emphasis on efficient working capital management, financial prudence, and discipline.
    *   **Processes:** Ongoing digital transformation to drive efficiency and improve customer satisfaction. Automation is integrated into operations. Internal controls aim for optimal resource utilization. Internal audits review SOPs and suggest best practices.

### Potential Opportunities

*   *   Leveraging the significant funding (₹765 Cr) and strategic partnerships of the RE JV Platform.
    *   Capitalizing on strong market demand in high-growth, high-IRR segments.
