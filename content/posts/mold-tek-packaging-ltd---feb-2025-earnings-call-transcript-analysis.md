## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

#### Paint Segment

*   Shift towards IML (In-Mold Labelling) is improving.

#### Pharma Packaging

*   Described as a "very huge market of more than INR3,000 crores, INR4,000 crores per annum." Government tightening standards for pharma production, potentially increasing demand for quality packaging.

### Competitive Positioning

#### IML

*   Mold-Tek positions itself as a leader with robotic capacities, in-house IML, and design capabilities, making it a "better choice for players like Asian Paints or even KNP and Berger."

#### Pharma

*   Differentiating through rapid new product development, in-house tool room, design team, and world-class facilities. Unique canister design (single-piece with laser marking).

#### Pricing

*   Acknowledges being "a little expensive than other players" due to R&D, design, and robotics costs, which might be a reason for losing some business with Asian Paints.

### Market Challenges & Opportunities

#### Paint Segment

*   Price pressure exists. Losing volume with Asian Paints due to pricing and redistribution. Opportunity with ABG's growth and increasing IML adoption by existing players.

#### Lubes Segment

*   Competition "not so severe," hence price pressure is "not so much."

#### Food & FMCG Segment

*   Increased competition from "small players with a couple of machines" especially in ice creams and dairy. Growth opportunity from Panipat plant catering to North India, and new clients like Surf Excel and Horlicks.

#### Qpack (Square Pack)

*   Demand improving in the North, supported by patent enforcement.

### Market Share/Positioning Comments

*   **Asian Paints:** Lost almost 10% volume. Management hopes to stabilize share next year.
*   **Aditya Birla Group (ABG):** All major paint packaging suppliers (except Hi-Tech) are associated with ABG. Management does not foresee ABG entering plastic molding directly.
*   **Pharma:** Aiming for significant market share in the long term (e.g., 20% of sales in 5 years). Current competitors include Shriji Polymers (largest), Gerresheimer, Gopaldas, Dr. Pack, Bericap.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Supply Chain/Operational Constraints

*   Past challenge: Printing capacity for IML and timely procurement impacted supplies in Food & FMCG and Paints. (This is now being addressed with new machines).
*   Past challenge: Pharma mold availability impacted confirmed orders. (This is now resolved).

### Client-Specific Challenges

#### Asian Paints Volume Loss

*   Lost ~10% volume due to "redistribution of volumes between the vendors based on pricing." Also attributed to tepid growth in Asian Paints' own volumes.

### Market Uncertainties/Competition

#### Paint Segment Growth

*   Management cautious about overall paint segment growth.
