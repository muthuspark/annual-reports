### Potential Challenges and Opportunities

*   **Challenges:**

    *   Cybersecurity threats and the need for continuous adaptation to new technologies represent ongoing challenges.
    *   Intense competition exists in the IT services industry.
    *   Talent acquisition, retention, and upskilling are crucial for growth.
    *    Changing immigration regulations could affect the Company's ability to deploy personnel globally.
*   **Opportunities:**

    *   Generative AI and its potential applications, as reflected in Coforge's "Quasar" platform, represent a key growth area.

### Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions

*   **Revenue Growth Sensitivity:** The Company's 13.3% constant currency revenue growth in FY24 demonstrates resilience. If the global economy slows more than the predicted 3.2% growth rate, revenue growth could be negatively impacted, especially in sensitive sectors like BFS and Travel.
*   **Margin Sensitivity:** Gross margins have remained flat at 32.6%. The stated increase in sales, marketing, and pre-sales costs, bucketed under SG&A, impacted EBITDA margins. If these investments do not yield the expected return in terms of new client acquisition and deal closures, margins could be further pressured.
*   **Large Deal Sensitivity:** The FY24 order intake of USD 1.97 billion (up 56% YoY) and the record 12-month executable order book of USD 1.02 billion provide near-term revenue visibility. However, any significant delays or cancellations in these large deals could negatively impact revenue projections.
*   **Partnership Success Sensitivity:** The success of the partnership-led growth strategy depends on the effective collaboration and integration with platform partners. If these partnerships do not deliver the anticipated synergies, growth targets may be missed.
*   **Acquisition Success Sensitivity:** If the planned Qualified Institutional Placement to fund acquisitions, up to INR 32,000 Mn, does not result in value-accretive acquisitions, the company could fail to meet its expansion goals.
*   **Macroeconomic Condition Sensitivity:** Changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical environment affects the Company's risks related to foreign exchange, customers' and prospective customers' technology spending.

### Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** Generally high, evidenced by the unmodified audit opinion and adherence to Ind AS. The use of estimates (e.g., impairment provisions, revenue recognition on fixed-price contracts, fair value of financial instruments) introduces an element of subjectivity, but processes and controls appear robust.
*   **Regulatory Risk:**
    *   Moderate. The slight delays in depositing statutory dues, although quantified, indicate a need for strengthened internal processes.
    *   The ongoing tax disputes, while assessed as not having a material adverse effect by management, present a potential risk that needs continuous monitoring.
    *   The audit trail feature of the accounting software not being enabled at the database level for direct data changes poses some risk to financial reporting.
