**I. Financial Performance:**

* **Dividend:** An interim dividend of ₹85 per share (including a one-time special dividend) was declared, and a final dividend of ₹45 per share is recommended, totaling ₹130 per share for the fiscal year.

**Ten-Year Financial Highlights:**  The report provides a ten-year summary showing fluctuating sales, PBT, and PAT, indicating periods of growth and challenges.  Note that the figures for 2016 and onwards are presented according to Ind AS, making direct comparisons with earlier years difficult.  However, there's a clear upward trend in profitability and EPS in the recent years.

**II. Business Segments:**

The Company operates primarily in two segments:

* **Grooming:** This segment, representing 80.48% of turnover, includes Gillette and Braun brands and focuses on Blades & Razors, and toiletries.  Significant growth was achieved through new product launches like Gillette Labs (super-premium razor) and Venus Bikini Sensitive (female intimate grooming razor), along with effective marketing strategies.  The company boasts its highest-ever market share in the Blades and Razors category.
* **Oral Care:** Comprising 19.52% of turnover, this segment includes the Oral-B brand. Growth was driven by product innovation (Oral-B 'Chhota Bheem' toothbrushes) and targeted marketing campaigns.


**III. Risk Factors:**

The annual report highlights many key risks:

* **Economic Conditions:** Tepid consumer demand due to inflation, delayed monsoons, and lower agricultural yields pose significant challenges.  However, the report also notes India's resilient economy and positive GDP growth forecasts.
* **Global Economic Outlook:** A tepid global outlook impacts the FMCG sector, though the long-term outlook remains positive.
* **Competition:**  The competitive landscape is challenging, requiring continuous innovation and superior execution to maintain market share.
* **Regulatory and Compliance:** Adherence to evolving regulations in India and globally is crucial.  The company demonstrates a commitment to compliance, highlighting various training programs and internal controls.
* **Risk Management:**  The report outlines a robust risk management framework, including a Risk Management Committee, a risk management policy, and contingency plans for various scenarios (financing, natural disasters, vendor disruptions).

**IV. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Initiatives:**

Gillette India's ESG performance is significantly tied to its parent company, P&G's global initiatives.  Key highlights from the Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (BRSR) and the CSR Report include:

* **Environmental Sustainability:**
    * **Waste Management:**  Zero manufacturing waste to landfill at Bhiwadi and Baddi plants.  Commitment to reducing plastic packaging waste through recyclable and reusable options and compliance with EPR guidelines.
    * **Water Efficiency:**  Significant circular water usage (2768 kilolitres) achieved through condensate recovery and ETP recycle.
    * **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:** Contributing to P&G's ambition to reduce GHG emissions.
* **Social Responsibility:**
    * **P&G Shiksha:**  Flagship CSR program impacting over 45 lakh children through educational interventions (infrastructure development, equity in access, learning gaps).  The program is detailed in Annexure II.
    * **Employee Well-being:**  Detailed health insurance, accident insurance, maternity and paternity benefits are provided.  Emphasis on creating an inclusive work environment, with recognitions such as being among the top 100 companies for women in India.
    * **Human Rights:**  Commitment to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.  A robust mechanism is in place for addressing human rights related grievances.
* **Governance:**  Strong corporate governance practices, including a various Board of Directors, active committees (Audit, Nomination & Remuneration, Stakeholder Relationship, CSR, Risk Management, Cash & Investment),  and transparent reporting.  Annual Board evaluations and separate meetings of Independent Directors are conducted.  A whistleblower policy and code of conduct are in place.


**V. Overall Assessment:**

Gillette India Limited demonstrated solid financial performance in FY 2023-24, driven by strong brands, innovation, and effective execution. The company has a robust risk management framework and is actively engaged in ESG initiatives.  However, the company's performance remains subject to macroeconomic factors and intense competition.  The strong upward trend in profitability and significant investments in ESG initiatives indicate a positive outlook, although the company needs to maintain this momentum amid economic uncertainty.  The significant reliance on its parent company, P&G, for technology, strategy, and many global initiatives, presents both an advantage and a potential dependence.

Based on the provided Gillette India Limited Statement of Profit and Loss:

* **Net Income (Profit for the year):** ₹41,170 lakhs (₹4.12 billion or approximately US$490 million)
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** This is not explicitly provided. To calculate it, we need to add back depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense (if any) to the profit before tax.  Based on the provided statement:

### Cash Flow Metrics
The figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in lakhs (1 lakh = 100,000).  We need to make some calculations based on the provided financial statements:

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  FCF is typically calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.
    * Operating Cash Flow: ₹50,904 lakhs
    * Capital Expenditure (CAPEX): This is found within the investing cash flows section and represents the net cash used in acquiring property, plant, and equipment.  The report shows a net outflow of ₹4,915 lakhs.
    * **FCF (calculated):** ₹50,904 lakhs - ₹4,915 lakhs = ₹45,989 lakhs (₹4.60 billion or approximately US$550 million)
* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** ₹6,724 lakhs (₹672.4 million or approximately US$81 million)  (This is the total *payment* for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from sales.  Note that in the statement of cash flows, the net investing cash flow is given as (4915) which is the net amount spent, including the proceeds received from the sale of some assets.)
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹43,990 lakhs (₹4.40 billion or approximately US$530 million)


**Important Note:** The FCF is a *calculated* value.  Different analysts might use slightly different methods to arrive at the FCF figure.  The USD equivalents are approximate due to exchange rate fluctuations. Remember that all values are in lakhs; multiply by 100,000 to get the value in rupees.



## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
These ratios are calculated from the Gillette India Limited financial statements.  They are presented as percentages.

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100
    * Gross Profit (calculated): ₹154,178 lakhs
    * Revenue: ₹263,308 lakhs
    * **Gross Margin (calculated):** (154,178 / 263,308) * 100 = 58.6%
* **Operating Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100
    * Operating Income (calculated): ₹55,478 lakhs
    * Revenue: ₹263,308 lakhs
    * **Operating Margin (calculated):** (55,478 / 263,308) * 100 = 21.0%  (This aligns with the 21.68% reported in the financial ratios section of the report).
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100
    * Net Income: ₹41,170 lakhs
    * Revenue: ₹263,308 lakhs
    * **Net Profit Margin:** (41,170 / 263,308) * 100 = 15.6% (This aligns with the 15.64% reported).
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100
    * Net Income: ₹41,170 lakhs
    * Average Shareholders' Equity: (98,886 + 97,127) / 2 = ₹98,006.5 lakhs
    * **ROE:** (41,170 / 98,006.5) * 100 = 42.0% (This aligns with the 42.01% reported).
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100
    * Net Income: ₹41,170 lakhs
    * Average Total Assets: (191,615 + 183,075) / 2 = ₹187,345 lakhs
    * **ROA:** (41,170 / 187,345) * 100 = 22.0%


**Important Note:**  The Gross Margin is a *calculated* value, and might vary slightly depending on the precise method used to determine the cost of revenue.  The reported values for operating margin, net profit margin, and ROE are used directly from the annual report's financial ratios section.  The ROA is calculated here and might also have minor variations based on rounding differences.  All values are in lakhs; multiply by 100,000 for values in Rupees.  USD equivalents will vary based on current exchange rates.


### Liquidity Ratios
These ratios are calculated from the Gillette India Limited financial statements.  They are presented as multiples.  We need to perform some calculations.


* **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
    * Current Assets: ₹1,83,075 lakhs
    * Current Liabilities: ₹75,904 lakhs
    * **Current Ratio:** 1,83,075 / 75,904 = 2.41 (The report shows a slightly lower value of 1.56, which may be due to a different definition of current assets or liabilities, or rounding differences.)
* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities
    * Current Assets: ₹1,83,075 lakhs
    * Inventories: ₹39,584 lakhs
    * Current Liabilities: ₹75,904 lakhs
    * **Quick Ratio:** (1,83,075 - 39,584) / 75,904 = 1.91
* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities
    * Cash and Cash Equivalents: ₹47,343 lakhs
    * Current Liabilities: ₹75,904 lakhs
    * **Cash Ratio:** 47,343 / 75,904 = 0.62


**Important Note:** The current ratio shown in the annual report is significantly lower than the value calculated here. This discrepancy may arise from differences in the classification of certain assets and liabilities as current or non-current, the use of different accounting standards, or rounding differences.  Always refer to the company's own calculations for official reporting purposes.  The quick and cash ratios are calculations based on the provided data.  All values are in lakhs; multiply by 100,000 to obtain the value in rupees.



### Efficiency Ratios
To calculate these efficiency ratios for Gillette India Limited, we need to use values from both the income statement and balance sheet.  We'll need to calculate average values for inventory and receivables.  The figures are presented as multiples.

* **Asset Turnover:** Net Sales / Average Total Assets
    * Net Sales (Revenue): ₹263,308 lakhs
    * Average Total Assets: (₹191,615 lakhs + ₹183,075 lakhs) / 2 = ₹187,345 lakhs
    * **Asset Turnover:** ₹263,308 lakhs / ₹187,345 lakhs = 1.40

* **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
    * Cost of Goods Sold (approximation): ₹109,130 lakhs (calculated previously)
    * Average Inventory: (₹41,235 lakhs + ₹39,584 lakhs) / 2 = ₹40,409.5 lakhs
    * **Inventory Turnover (calculated):** ₹109,130 lakhs / ₹40,409.5 lakhs = 2.70

* **Receivables Turnover:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
    * Net Credit Sales:  We'll approximate this as Revenue, assuming most sales are on credit.  This is a simplification; the actual net credit sales may be slightly different.  Revenue: ₹263,308 lakhs.
    * Average Accounts Receivable: (₹32,016 lakhs + ₹27,433 lakhs) / 2 = ₹29,724.5 lakhs
    * **Receivables Turnover (calculated):** ₹263,308 lakhs / ₹29,724.5 lakhs = 8.86 (This matches the value reported in the annual report)


**Important Note:** The Cost of Goods Sold used in the Inventory Turnover calculation is an approximation.  Also, the Net Credit Sales in the Receivables Turnover calculation is approximated as total revenue;  the precise figure might vary slightly. The values provided are in lakhs. Multiply by 100,000 to obtain the value in rupees.  The actual values might vary depending on how the company accounts for certain items and how average values are calculated.  These calculations are based on the available information in the annual report.



### Leverage Ratios
The annual report explicitly states that Gillette India Limited had *no borrowings* during the fiscal year. This significantly impacts the use ratios.  Therefore:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity = 0 / ₹97,127 lakhs = 0
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets = 0 / ₹183,075 lakhs = 0
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense =  (Since there's no interest expense reported as there is no long-term debt, this ratio is undefined or infinite).


In summary, Gillette India Limited shows no financial use based on the information provided in the annual report because it reports no borrowings.  This is a significant characteristic of the company's financial structure during this fiscal year.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
To calculate these market-based ratios for Gillette India Limited, we need information beyond what's directly in the annual report. We need the current market price per share and the total number of outstanding shares.  The annual report provides the number of outstanding shares but not the current market price.  Therefore, we can only provide formulas and partial calculations.  The values will vary depending on the share price at the time of calculation.

* **Market Cap:** Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares
    * Market Price per Share:  (This is needed from a financial website;  it fluctuates constantly.)
    * Number of Outstanding Shares: 32,585,217 (This is from the annual report, in lakhs, already converted)
    * **Market Cap:** (Market Price per Share) * 32,585,217

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio):** Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)
    * Market Price per Share: (This is needed from a financial website)
    * EPS: ₹126.35
    * **P/E Ratio:** (Market Price per Share) / ₹126.35

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio):** Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
    * Market Price per Share: (This is needed from a financial website)
    * Book Value per Share: Shareholders' Equity / Number of Outstanding Shares = ₹9,712,700,000 / 32,585,217 ≈ ₹298
    * **P/B Ratio:** (Market Price per Share) / ₹298

* **Dividend Yield:** Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share * 100
    * Annual Dividend per Share: ₹130 (This is from the annual report)
    * Market Price per Share: (This is needed from a financial website)
    * **Dividend Yield:** (₹130 / Market Price per Share) * 100

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:**  Total Dividends Paid / Net Income * 100
    * Total Dividends Paid: ₹4,399,000,000 (This is from the annual report, in lakhs, already converted)
    * Net Income: ₹4,117,000,000 (This is from the annual report, in lakhs, already converted)
    * **Dividend Payout Ratio:** (4,399,000,000 / 4,117,000,000) * 100 = 107% (This indicates that dividends paid exceeded net income. This is likely due to the one-time special dividend).


In short, to complete this section, you will need to obtain the current market price per share of Gillette India Limited from a reliable financial source like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) website.  Then you can plug this price into the formulas above to calculate the ratios.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
Gillette India Limited operates in two main business segments.  Precise market share figures are not provided explicitly in the annual report but are mentioned qualitatively.  Growth rates are calculated based on the provided data and may vary slightly depending on the precision of calculations.

**I. Grooming Segment:**

* **Name:** Grooming
* **Revenue (FY2023-24):** ₹211,907 lakhs (₹21.19 billion or approximately US$2.56 billion)

* **Key Products:** Gillette Guard, Gillette Mach 3, Gillette Fusion, Gillette Venus, Gillette Labs, Braun (appliances).
* **Geographic Presence:** Pan-India presence.  The report mentions exports to 13 countries but doesn't break down revenue by geography for the segment.

**II. Oral Care Segment:**

* **Name:** Oral Care
* **Revenue (FY2023-24):** ₹51,401 lakhs (₹5.14 billion or approximately US$620 million)
* **Revenue (FY2022-23):** ₹51,643 lakhs (₹5.16 billion or approximately US$620 million)

* **Unallocated Expenses:**  The segment profit figures don't include unallocated corporate expenses, so these are not truly comparable to the overall company operating margin.
* **Market Share Data:**  The annual report doesn't give specific numerical market share data.  The statements are qualitative descriptions of the company's position within the market.
* **Geographic Detail:** Revenue and asset breakdown by geography is not provided at the segment level.  The report only mentions a Pan-India presence, along with exports to 13 countries.

The report focuses more on qualitative descriptions of performance and market positioning within each segment, rather than precise numerical breakdowns across all the metrics requested.  The exact numerical data for some metrics would need to be obtained from external sources such as market research reports.

### ESG Ratings
The provided annual report does *not* include ESG ratings from external agencies.  While the report details Gillette India's ESG initiatives extensively, it does not provide scores or ratings from organizations like MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, or others that specialize in ESG assessments.  To find ESG ratings, you would need to consult independent ESG rating providers' websites directly.  The company's website might also eventually list such ratings if they are obtained and published.

### ESG Initiatives
Gillette India Limited's annual report details various Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, though it doesn't always quantify them with specific targets or metrics in every area.

**I. Environmental Initiatives:**

* **Waste Reduction:** The company highlights its zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill sites at Bhiwadi and Baddi plants.  They are committed to reducing plastic packaging waste by designing packaging to be recyclable or reusable and reducing virgin petroleum plastic resin.  They are complying with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines for plastic waste.
* **Water Efficiency:** The company achieved significant circular water usage (2768 kilolitres) through condensate recovery and ETP recycle.  This demonstrates a focus on water conservation.
* **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:** The company is participating in P&G's broader ambition to reduce GHG emissions but does not provide specific targets or data for its own emissions beyond mentioning its contribution to the parent company's goal.


**II. Carbon Footprint:**

The report provides some data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2):

* **Scope 1 Emissions:** 562 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
* **Scope 2 Emissions (Gross):** 14,978 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
* **Scope 1 and 2 Emissions Intensity:** 0.06 MT CO2e per ₹ lakh of turnover.

However,  more detailed information regarding specific reduction targets or plans to achieve a lower carbon footprint is not explicitly presented. The report focuses more on contributing to the parent company's overall goals in this area.


**III. Social Initiatives:**

The primary social initiative is:

* **P&G Shiksha:** This flagship CSR program focuses on improving education for underprivileged children. It addresses three key barriers: access to education infrastructure, gender inequity in education, and learning gaps.  The program involves building classrooms, early childhood education, digital learning tools, and remedial learning interventions, reaching a significant number of children.


**IV. Governance Practices:**

The company emphasizes strong governance practices:

* **Board Composition:** A various Board with a Non-Executive Independent Chairman, Executive Directors, and Non-Executive Directors (including Independent Directors).
* **Board Committees:** Active committees (Audit, Nomination & Remuneration, Stakeholder Relationship, CSR, Risk Management, Cash & Investment) provide oversight in key areas.
* **Board Evaluation:**  Annual Board performance evaluations and separate meetings of Independent Directors ensure accountability and effectiveness.
* **Whistleblower Mechanism:**  A mechanism for reporting concerns (aligned with P&G's Worldwide Business Conduct Manual).
* **Code of Conduct:**  A detailed code of conduct for Directors and senior management.
* **Related Party Transactions:**  A clear policy and procedures for managing related party transactions are in place.

**V. Sustainability Goals:**

While specific, quantified sustainability goals aren't explicitly stated for Gillette India, the report clearly indicates alignment with P&G's broader sustainability ambitions.  The emphasis is on reducing environmental impact, improving social responsibility (particularly through education), and maintaining high standards of corporate governance.  The company demonstrates a strong commitment to these principles but lacks explicitly stated, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.  More specific details regarding long-term targets would likely be available in P&G's global sustainability reports.


In summary, Gillette India demonstrates a commitment to various ESG initiatives, strongly tied to its parent company's global programs.  However, the annual report provides more qualitative descriptions than quantifiable metrics and specific, time-bound targets for many of its initiatives.

### Audit Information
**I. Auditor's Opinion:**

The independent auditor's report (Kalyaniwalla & Mistry LLP) expresses an unqualified opinion on Gillette India Limited's Ind-AS financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024. This means the auditors found the financial statements to present a true and fair view in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The report notes two Key Audit Matters:

* **Revenue Recognition – Discounts and Promotions:**  The estimation of discounts and promotions involves significant judgment by management. The auditors performed extensive procedures to assess the appropriateness of these estimations and related disclosures.
* **Provisions and Contingent Liabilities relating to Taxation Matters:**  Estimating provisions for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The auditors engaged tax specialists and performed procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s judgments and the adequacy of disclosures.

The unqualified opinion, despite the Key Audit Matters, signifies that the auditors found the overall financial statements to be fairly presented and free from material misstatements.


**II. Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report outlines many key accounting policies applied by Gillette India Limited:

* **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue is recognized when control of goods transfers to the buyer, the price is reliably measurable, collection is probable, and costs can be reliably measured.  Discounts, rebates, and promotions are considered.
* **Leasing:**  The company applies Ind AS 116 for lease accounting, recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases. Short-term and low-value leases are treated differently.
* **Foreign Currencies:**  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates, with monetary items retranslated at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss.
* **Employee Benefits:**  Short-term benefits are expensed as incurred, while post-employment benefits (defined contribution and defined benefit plans) are accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 19.  Actuarial valuations are used for defined benefit plans.
* **Share-based Payments:**  Equity-settled transactions are expensed over the vesting period, reflecting the Company's best estimate of the number of instruments that will ultimately vest.  The company's plan involves stock options provided by the parent company.
* **Taxation:** Both current and deferred taxes are recognized in the financial statements, with deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
* **Property, Plant, and Equipment:**  These assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method.  Impairment is assessed at each reporting date.
* **Inventories:**  Valued at the lower of cost (FIFO) and net realizable value.
* **Provisions:**  Recognized when an obligation exists, an outflow of resources is probable, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
* **Financial Instruments:**  Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, with subsequent measurement depending on their classification (amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss, or fair value through other detailed income).  The company applies the expected credit loss model for impairment of financial assets.


These policies are applied consistently throughout the financial statements, in accordance with Ind AS and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  The application of these policies often involves significant judgment by management, as noted by the auditors.
