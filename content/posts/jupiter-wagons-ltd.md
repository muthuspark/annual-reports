* **Profit Before Tax (PBT):** ₹44.37 (116% increase YoY).
* **Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹33.34 (165% increase YoY).
* **EPS:** ₹8.27 (significantly up from ₹3.24 in FY23).
* **ROE:** 20.75% (up from 15.85% in FY23), indicating strong profitability relative to equity.
* **Debt-Equity Ratio:** 0.17 (improved from 0.25 in FY23), suggesting enhanced financial stability.
* **Order Book (as of 31st March 2024):** ₹710.17 Crores, providing strong revenue visibility for the next few years.


**II. Business Segments:**

JWL operates in many interconnected segments within the mobility sector:

* **Rail Mobility:** This is the largest segment, covering the design and manufacture of freight wagons (open, covered, flat, defense, container carriers, etc.) for Indian Railways and private parties.  Significant orders were secured from the Ministry of Defence and Railways, along with private clients. This segment showed exceptional growth in FY24.  The company is also vertically integrated, manufacturing key wagon components such as bogies, couplers, and draft gears.
* **Road & Multimodal Mobility:**  This segment focuses on load bodies for commercial vehicles, tailored to various applications (mining, construction, defense, municipal).  It also includes container manufacturing (ISO standards, specialized containers like refrigerated and BESS).  Growth in this segment was substantial, driven by increased demand for specialized containers.  A new electric light commercial vehicle (eLCV) is poised for launch.
* **Track Solutions:** JWL manufactures Cast Manganese Steel (CMS) crossings for railways, contributing to high-speed corridors.


**III. Risks:**

The annual report identifies many key risks:

* **Economic Risk:** Dependence on the overall health of the Indian and global economies, affecting demand and raw material prices.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
Based on the provided standalone financial statements:

* **Total Assets:** ₹279,569.41 Lakhs (₹27.96 Billion)
* **Current Assets:** ₹181,113.94 Lakhs (₹18.11 Billion)
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹11,186.41 Lakhs (₹1.12 Billion)  (This includes cash on hand, balances with banks, and short-term deposits.)
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** ₹46,909.10 Lakhs (₹4.69 Billion)
* **Inventory:** ₹90,674.53 Lakhs (₹9.07 Billion)


It's essential to note that these are *standalone* figures. The consolidated financial statements would include the assets of subsidiaries and joint ventures, resulting in higher values for total assets and the other line items.

### Liability Analysis
Based on the provided standalone financial statements:

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹117,372.00 Lakhs (₹11.74 Billion)  (This is calculated by subtracting total equity from total assets.)

* **Current Liabilities:** ₹113,055.81 Lakhs (₹11.31 Billion)

* **Long-Term Debt (Borrowings - Non-Current):** ₹763.80 Lakhs (₹7.64 Crores)

* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):** ₹44,081.30 Lakhs (₹4.41 Billion)


Again, these are *standalone* figures.  The consolidated figures would be higher because they encompass the liabilities of subsidiaries and joint ventures.

### Equity Analysis
Based on the provided standalone financial statements:

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹162,197.46 Lakhs (₹16.22 Billion)

* **Retained Earnings:** ₹70,444.20 Lakhs (₹7.04 Billion)

* **Share Capital:** ₹41,229.36 Lakhs (₹4.12 Billion)

These figures are for the standalone financial statements.  The consolidated statements would show different values, reflecting the equity of subsidiaries and the non-controlling interests.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Based on the standalone Statement of Profit and Loss:

* **Revenue:** ₹364,125.30 Lakhs (₹36.41 Billion)
* **Cost of Revenue (Cost of Materials Consumed + Changes in Inventories):** ₹284,298.79 Lakhs - ₹1,461.48 Lakhs = ₹282,837.31 Lakhs (₹28.28 Billion)
* **Gross Profit:** ₹364,125.30 Lakhs - ₹282,837.31 Lakhs = ₹81,287.99 Lakhs (₹8.13 Billion)
* **Operating Expenses (Employee benefits expense + Finance costs + Depreciation and amortisation expense + Other expenses):** ₹5,079.23 Lakhs + ₹4,080.61 Lakhs + ₹2,752.58 Lakhs + ₹27,105.95 Lakhs = ₹39,018.37 Lakhs (₹3.90 Billion)
* **Operating Income (EBITDA):** ₹49,102.81 Lakhs (₹4.91 Billion)  (Note that EBITDA is calculated before deducting  finance costs, depreciation, and taxes. The report shows EBITDA separately, so we don't need to calculate it from other values).


These are the *standalone* figures. Consolidated figures will differ due to the inclusion of subsidiary and joint venture results.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Based on the standalone Statement of Profit and Loss:

* **Net Income (Profit After Tax):** ₹33,279.50 Lakhs (₹3.33 Billion)
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** ₹49,102.81 Lakhs (₹4.91 Billion)
* **Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):** ₹8.27
* **Diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share):** ₹8.27


These are the standalone figures.  The consolidated statement will present different values, reflecting the performance of subsidiaries and joint ventures.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:

* **Net Cash (Used in)/Generated from Operating Activities:**  (₹634.88 Lakhs)  (A negative value indicates a net cash outflow from operations.)

* **Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:** (₹48,672.45 Lakhs) (A negative value indicates a net cash outflow from investing activities.)

* **Net Cash Generated from Financing Activities:** ₹48,911.93 Lakhs (A positive value indicates a net cash inflow from financing activities.)


These are standalone figures. The consolidated cash flow statement would include the cash flows of subsidiaries and joint ventures and therefore show different numbers.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The provided annual report doesn't directly state the free cash flow.  Free cash flow is calculated, not a directly reported line item.  To calculate it, we need information not explicitly given in the summarized financials.  A proper calculation would require a detailed statement of cash flows showing all cash inflows and outflows.  We only have a summary.


However, we can determine the following from the report's Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:


* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  This is implied by the investing cash flow which includes "Purchases of property, plant and equipment, capital work in progress, intangibles assets under development, intangibles assets, capital creditors and capital advances".  The total net outflow from investing activities was ₹48,672.45 Lakhs. While a portion of this might represent other investing activities, a significant part represents CAPEX.  A precise CAPEX figure needs a more detailed breakdown of investing activities.

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹3,234.32 Lakhs (This is explicitly stated in the standalone statement of cash flows).


To calculate free cash flow (FCF), a common formula is:

FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures + Proceeds from Sale of Assets

We have the dividends paid and a net negative operating cash flow.  We have a partial figure for capital expenditures (the total investing cash outflow), but lacking a precise CAPEX number and a complete picture of proceeds from asset sales, a precise free cash flow cannot be calculated from the provided data.  A detailed cash flow statement is needed for an accurate calculation.



## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
To calculate these profitability ratios for Jupiter Wagons Limited, we'll use the standalone financial statement data.  Remember that these will differ from the consolidated figures. All amounts are in Lakhs.

* **Revenue:** ₹364,125.30
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹282,837.31
* **Gross Profit:** ₹81,287.99
* **Operating Income (EBITDA):** ₹49,102.81
* **Profit Before Tax (PBT):** ₹44,368.45
* **Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹33,279.50
* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹162,197.46
* **Total Assets:** ₹279,569.41


Here are the profitability ratios:

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹81,287.99 / ₹364,125.30) * 100 = 22.32%

* **Operating Margin (EBITDA Margin):** (EBITDA / Revenue) * 100 = (₹49,102.81 / ₹364,125.30) * 100 = 13.49%

* **Net Profit Margin:** (PAT / Revenue) * 100 = (₹33,279.50 / ₹364,125.30) * 100 = 9.14%

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (PAT / Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (₹33,279.50 / ₹162,197.46) * 100 = 20.51%  (Note that the report itself shows 20.75%, this minor difference may be due to rounding.)

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (PAT / Total Assets) * 100 = (₹33,279.50 / ₹279,569.41) * 100 = 11.87%


These ratios provide insights into JWL's profitability and efficiency.  The high ROE suggests strong profitability relative to shareholder investment. The relatively lower ROA implies that the company's asset utilization could potentially be improved.  Comparison to industry benchmarks would provide a more detailed assessment.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate these liquidity ratios for Jupiter Wagons Limited, we'll use the standalone financial statement data. Remember that these will differ from the consolidated figures. All amounts are in Lakhs.

* **Current Assets:** ₹181,113.94
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹113,055.81
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹11,186.41
* **Accounts Receivable:** ₹46,909.10
* **Inventories:** ₹90,674.53


Here's the calculation of the liquidity ratios:

* **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹181,113.94 / ₹113,055.81 = 1.60

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (₹181,113.94 - ₹90,674.53) / ₹113,055.81 = 0.80

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹11,186.41 / ₹113,055.81 = 0.10


**Interpretation:**

* **Current Ratio (1.60):** This indicates that JWL has ₹1.60 of current assets for every ₹1 of current liabilities.  A ratio generally above 1 is considered healthy, suggesting the company can likely meet its short-term obligations.  However, the specific ideal ratio varies across industries.

* **Quick Ratio (0.80):**  This is a more stringent measure than the current ratio as it excludes inventories.  A quick ratio below 1 suggests that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations if it cannot quickly liquidate its inventories.

* **Cash Ratio (0.10):** This is the most conservative measure, focusing only on highly liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents).  The low cash ratio (significantly below 1) indicates that JWL has a relatively low level of immediately available cash to cover its short-term liabilities.


**Important Note:** These are standalone liquidity ratios. The consolidated figures would offer a different picture, considering the liquidity position of the subsidiaries and joint ventures.  Furthermore, a meaningful interpretation requires comparing these ratios to industry averages and trends for JWL over time.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating efficiency ratios requires more data than is readily available in the provided summary financial statements.  We need the beginning-of-year values for assets, inventory, and receivables to calculate accurate averages.  The report provides end-of-year values and some turnover ratios, but these appear to use year-end values rather than average values.  Using year-end values alone can lead to inaccurate results.

The report does state the following turnover ratios, but we cannot verify their calculation methodology:

* **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** 4.05 times (using year-end values, likely)
* **Receivables Turnover Ratio:** 10.67 times (using year-end values, likely)
* **Asset Turnover:** Not explicitly stated.


To calculate these correctly, using the average of the beginning and end-of-year balances, we need the following data which are not present in the report's summary:

* **Beginning-of-year (FY23) Total Assets:**  Needed for Asset Turnover.
* **Beginning-of-year (FY23) Inventory:** Needed for Inventory Turnover.
* **Beginning-of-year (FY23) Accounts Receivable:** Needed for Receivables Turnover.
* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**  Needed for Inventory Turnover.  While "Cost of Materials Consumed" is provided, it is not precisely COGS.  Adjustments might be necessary to properly calculate COGS.


**Formulas:**

* **Asset Turnover:** Revenue / Average Total Assets
* **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
* **Receivables Turnover:** Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable


Once the missing data is obtained,  the above formulas can be applied to calculate more accurate efficiency ratios. The reported values in the annual report may use only year-end figures, which can result in potentially misleading results.

### Leverage Ratios
We can calculate some use ratios using the standalone financial statement data. Remember these will differ from the consolidated figures. All amounts are in Lakhs.

* **Total Debt (Non-Current + Current Borrowings):** ₹33,767.03
* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹162,197.46
* **Total Assets:** ₹279,569.41
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** ₹49,102.81
* **Interest Expense:** ₹4,080.61


Here are the use ratios:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity = ₹33,767.03 / ₹162,197.46 = 0.21

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets = ₹33,767.03 / ₹279,569.41 = 0.12

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** EBITDA / Interest Expense = ₹49,102.81 / ₹4,080.61 = 12.03


**Interpretation:**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (0.21):** This indicates that for every ₹1 of equity, JWL has ₹0.21 of debt. This is a relatively low ratio, suggesting a conservative capital structure and lower financial risk compared to companies with higher debt-to-equity ratios.

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio (0.12):** This shows that 12% of JWL's assets are financed by debt.  Similar to the debt-to-equity ratio, this indicates a low level of financial leverage.

* **Interest Coverage Ratio (12.03):** This means JWL's EBITDA is 12.03 times its interest expense.  A high interest coverage ratio is generally favorable, signifying the company's ability to comfortably meet its interest obligations.


**Important Note:** These are standalone use ratios.  Consolidated figures would likely show different results, reflecting the debt levels of subsidiaries and joint ventures.  Furthermore, these ratios should be benchmarked against industry averages and analyzed in the context of JWL's historical performance and overall financial strategy.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided annual report does *not* contain the information needed to calculate the market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, dividend yield, and dividend payout ratio.  These metrics require information from the stock market, not just the company's financial statements.  Specifically, we need:

* **Current Market Price per Share:** To calculate market cap and PE ratio.
* **Number of Outstanding Shares:** To calculate market cap.
* **Book Value per Share:** To calculate PB ratio.  This requires the total book value of equity divided by the total number of outstanding shares.
* **Annual Dividend per Share:** To calculate dividend yield.


The report *does* provide the following:

* **Profit After Tax (PAT):**  Used in the PE ratio calculation.
* **Annual Dividend per Share (Proposed):** ₹0.30 (Note: This is a proposed dividend, not necessarily the dividend actually paid).
* **Number of Outstanding Shares (Year-End):** 412,293,625 (standalone; consolidated would be different).


**Formulas (assuming the use of the standalone number of outstanding shares):**

* **Market Cap:** Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares

* **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share (EPS)

* **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share

* **Dividend Yield:** (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100 (This uses the *actually paid* dividend, not the proposed dividend.)


Without the market price per share and book value per share, we cannot calculate the market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, or dividend yield.  While we can calculate a *proposed* dividend payout ratio, it's important to remember that until the dividend is declared and paid by the company, this is only a projected value.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The Jupiter Wagons Limited annual report doesn't provide a detailed segmental breakdown with precise market share figures for each segment.  The report groups segments broadly and offers some summary information.  Precise revenue figures for each segment are not directly available; however, we can infer some information.  Growth rates are calculated based on year-on-year changes in revenue, assuming the provided revenue numbers entirely reflect the segment’s performance (this is a simplification, as some revenue may span multiple segments):


**I. Rail Mobility:**

* **Name:** Railway Wagons
* **Revenue:**  ₹311,365.96 Lakhs (estimated; a significant portion of total revenue)
* **Growth Rate (YoY):** Approximately 91.31% (calculated based on year on year revenue increase for railway wagons)
* **Operating Margin:** Not explicitly broken down by segment. Overall EBITDA margin was 13.49%, this segment is expected to have contributed majorly to overall profitability.
* **Market Share:** Not explicitly stated in the report.
* **Key Products:** Open wagons, covered wagons, flat wagons, defense wagons, container carrier wagons, cement wagons, car carrier wagons, coil carrier wagons.
* **Geographic Presence:** Primarily India (all locations).


**II. Road & Multimodal Mobility:**

* **Name:** Commercial Vehicle Load Bodies & Components, Containers
* **Revenue:** ₹45,333.50 Lakhs (estimated; commercial vehicle portion, containers are also included in this revenue segment)
* **Growth Rate (YoY):** Approximately 31.10% (calculated based on YoY revenue increase for this business segment; again this is a simplified calculation)
* **Operating Margin:** Not explicitly broken down by segment.
* **Market Share:** Not explicitly stated.
* **Key Products:** Load bodies for commercial vehicles (tippers, trailers, tankers, etc.), specialized containers (refrigerated, BESS, etc.).
* **Geographic Presence:** Primarily India (all locations).


**III. Track Solutions:**

* **Name:** CMS Crossings
* **Revenue:** ₹1,349.18 Lakhs (explicitly stated)
* **Growth Rate (YoY):** Negative growth (-61.08%)
* **Operating Margin:**  Not explicitly stated.
* **Market Share:** Not explicitly stated.
* **Key Products:** Cast manganese steel crossings for Indian Railways and other railways.
* **Geographic Presence:** Primarily India (all locations).


**Other Segments:**  The report includes "Others" in the revenue figures, covering unspecified activities.  The E-LCV and drone segments are still developing and their contribution to revenue in FY24 is not quantified.

**Limitations:**

The report lacks a detailed segmental analysis, making precise calculations of growth rates and operating margins for individual segments impossible without accessing more detailed data from the company's complete financial statements. The provided growth rate and revenue numbers are approximations.  Also, the exact revenue breakdown and inter-segment dependencies are unclear.  The reported turnover numbers might include sales across multiple segments (e.g., a container carrier wagon would appear in both Rail and Road segments).



### Risk Assessment
The Jupiter Wagons Limited annual report outlines many key risk factors.  While the report doesn't explicitly assign numerical likelihood or severity scores, we can categorize the risks and analyze the described mitigation strategies.  The trends section speculates on future risk developments based on the information provided.

**I. Key Risk Factors:**

The following table categorizes the key risk factors identified in the report:
