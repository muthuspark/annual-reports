*   **EBITDA:** Rose to INR 3,654.59 crore in FY24 from INR 2,423.57 crore in FY23, reflecting improved operational leverage and revenue growth.
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT) (Loss):** The consolidated loss widened to INR (659.55) crore in FY24 from INR (57.04) crore in FY23, primarily due to increased finance costs (INR 2,830.16 Cr in FY24 vs INR 2,115.82 Cr in FY23) and higher depreciation & amortization expenses (INR 1,611.01 Cr in FY24 vs INR 1,386.69 Cr in FY23) associated with significant capital expenditure on airport expansions and new projects. Exceptional items also played a role, with a net gain of INR 115.08 crore in FY24 compared to a gain of INR 816.41 crore in FY23 (which included gains from the Cebu stake sale).

At the erstwhile GAL level (now merged), INR 5,000 crore was raised via senior unsecured bonds for refinancing, equity investment in Bhogapuram, buy-out of MAHB's 11% stake in GHIAL, and liquidity for new projects. DIAL raised INR 2,744 crore (NCDs), GHIAL INR 540 crore (NCDs), and GGIAL INR 2,475 crore (NCDs) for expansion, refinancing, and capex. GVIAL achieved financial closure for INR 3,215 crore.
