## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends:

Strong demand for integrated CDMO offerings, particularly using advanced technologies (Biocatalysis, Flow Chem). Mention of market impact from IRA pricing pressure. Growing interest from innovators seeking China-alternative supply chains.

### Competitive Positioning:

Leveraging technology platforms and integrated offerings to deepen Big Pharma relationships. Strong position in ARVs. Building position in niche areas like cell/gene therapy intermediates and ADC components.

### Market Challenges/Opportunities:

Macroeconomic challenges persist. Uncertainty around US HIV funding (PEPFAR/USAID) and potential US tariffs on China impacting the broader market. Opportunity seen in diversification towards CDMO and capturing business from Big Pharma seeking reliable partners with advanced tech capabilities.

### Market Share/Positioning:

Dominant in ARVs. Growing CDMO share (from 13% to 28% of revenue over 5 years).
