## ESG Framework at Manaksia Coated Metals & Industries Limited (MCMIL)

### Environmental Metrics and Targets

MCMIL demonstrates a commitment to environmental management through several initiatives and certifications. The company actively promotes a "Green Initiative" by encouraging shareholders to opt for electronic communications to reduce paper consumption and carbon footprint. MCMIL holds ISO 14001:2015 certification for Environmental Management Systems.

Energy conservation measures reported include maintenance of near-unity power factor, use of agro-based fuel in mosquito coil manufacturing, utilization of natural lighting, replacement of conventional lamps with energy-efficient alternatives, and conducting energy conservation training programs. An alternate energy source, a Thermal Fluid heating system, is used for drying mosquito coils. A key project enhancing environmental performance was the upgrade of the Continuous Colour Coating Line (CCL) in April 2022, which included the installation of a new thermal incinerator to improve fuel efficiency. For the reported financial year, capital investment specifically designated for energy conservation equipment was stated as NIL.

### Social Responsibility Programs

MCMIL's social responsibility is primarily executed through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities and employee welfare measures. The company has a CSR policy, with activities focused on areas such as rural development (including livestock), promotion of education, protection of fauna, and healthcare, with a preference for local areas around its operations. For FY 2023-24, the CSR obligation was Rs. 16.89 lakhs (calculated from an average net profit of Rs. 908.88 lakhs, a 2% obligation of Rs. 18.18 lakhs, less a set-off of Rs. 1.32 lakhs from previous years), which was fully spent. As the CSR expenditure did not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs, the functions of the CSR Committee are discharged by the Board of Directors.

The company maintains a policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace, with an Internal Complaints Committee in place; no cases were reported or pending in FY24. MCMIL holds OHSAS 18001:2007 certification for Occupational Health and Safety Management. Employee relations were reported as positive, with a workforce of approximately 282 personnel.

This involved upgrading the electrical automation system and installing a new thermal incinerator for improved fuel efficiency. The ROI is increased production of high-value-added products and reduced fuel costs.
2.  **Conversion of Galvanizing Line to Alu-Zinc Coating (Ongoing, expected completion FY 2025):** This technological upgrade aims to produce a superior product (Alu-Zinc Coated Steel) offering enhanced durability (reportedly up to four times longer life) and commanding a market premium. The project is expected to increase the plant's coated product capacity by 36%, to a total of 180,000 MTPA. The ROI is anticipated through higher-margin products, increased production capacity, and enhanced market competitiveness.
3.  **New Cold Rolling Complex and Second Appliance-Grade Colour Coating Line (Planned):** These projects are aimed at backward integration and further capacity enhancement, contributing to the overall coated product capacity target of 180,000 TPA.

These investments align with strategies to improve plant efficiencies, reduce operational costs, and increase the production of high-value-added products.

### Regulatory Compliance and Future Preparations

MCMIL reports compliance with key regulatory frameworks. The Corporate Governance Report confirms adherence to SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 (specifically Regulations 17 to 27, 46, and Schedule V).
