*   **Trend:** Increasing demand in underserved areas (Uttar Pradesh and Bihar). Medanta added 126 new beds during the year, the Company's network of hospitals has expanded.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Capacity expansion in underserved markets (Lucknow and Patna). Planned addition of beds in existing facilities and development of new hospitals (Noida, South Delhi, Indore, Mumbai). Expansion of "Continuity of Care" services.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. Existing hospitals demonstrate operational success. New projects face execution risks.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Positive, long-term, if expansion is successful. Negative, if delays or operational inefficiencies occur, leading to increased capital expenditure without proportionate revenue increase.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium to High. Operational inefficiencies and high fixed costs can impact margins.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Risks include rising non-variable operating costs and occupancy rate fluctuations, potentially impacting margins and business growth.

*   **Control Effectiveness:** High.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Increased interest expenses and potential strain on cash flow if new projects face delays or cost overruns. Positive return on equity (17.93%) shows strong profitability relative to shareholder investment.

### Compliance/Regulatory Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The healthcare industry is highly regulated. Adverse government policies on pricing or operational restrictions could impact business.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Changes in regulations are constant.
