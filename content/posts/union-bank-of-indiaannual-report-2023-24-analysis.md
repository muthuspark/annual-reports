## Union Bank of India (FY 2023-24) - Forward Outlook

### Management Guidance and Assumptions

Union Bank of India's (UBI) management guidance for FY 2024-25 and beyond is based on a strong Indian economic outlook, with an expected GDP growth of about 7.0% (RBI estimate) and CPI inflation falling to around 4.5%. The Bank intends to improve its performance in line with the banking industry, taking advantage of a "sweet spot" in the Indian economy marked by strong GDP growth and supportive policy changes. Key assumptions include continued credit demand (expected double-digit growth for the sector), effective monetary policy transmission, and a stable interest rate environment. Management expects that continued government emphasis on capital expenditure will encourage private investment, boosting overall economic activity. A normal monsoon is also expected to boost rural demand. The Bank expects that increased digital adoption by customers and the successful completion of its internal digital and HR transformation projects (e.g., Vyom app, Ekam project) will increase efficiency and customer engagement.

### Market Growth and Industry Outlook

In FY24, the Indian banking sector performed exceptionally well, with rising profitability and improved asset quality. Credit growth significantly outpaced deposit growth, a trend expected to continue, albeit with credit growth moderating from decade-high levels. The banking system as a whole is well-capitalized. UBI's management predicts robust banking sector growth driven by stable interest rates, strong GDP, declining inflation, and government focus on development and infrastructure spending. Global economic growth is expected to remain at 3.2% (IMF), while Asia's GDP is expected to increase by 4.5% in 2024, with India being a major driver (projected real GDP growth of 6.8% in 2024 by IMF). Deposit growth for the Indian banking system is predicted at 12-13% in FY25, indicating continued competition for liabilities.

### Strategic Initiatives and Focus Areas

UBI's strategic focus is on "Customer Centricity with Innovative Technology," digital excellence, and sustainability. Key initiatives include:

1.  **Digital Transformation:** Continued investment in the Digital Business Platform (with IBM), aiming for 100+ digital journeys and a Super App. Enhancement of the Vyom mobile app (400+ features, 2.68 crore users), CRM solutions, and participation in CBDC. Leveraging AI/ML, RPA (Robotic Process Automation Centre of Excellence planned), and exploring Generative AI.
2.  **Liability Focus:** Prioritizing growth in CASA and retail customer deposits to calibrate credit growth. Introduction of tailored products like Union Samman (pensioners), Union Samriddhi (women), and Union Udaan (young professionals).
3.  **Credit Management:** Enhancing underwriting capabilities, verticalization, and analytics. Focus on RAM (Retail, Agriculture, MSME) segment growth (13.82% YoY in FY24). Agriculture advances grew 20.95% and MSME by 8.58% in FY24.
4.  **Sustainability (ESG):** Integrating ESG into business strategy with a Board-approved ESG Risk Framework and Climate Risk Policy. Significant financing for renewable energy (₹23,059 crore sanctioned by FY24-end) and green initiatives (Union Green Miles, Union Roof Top Solar). Aiming for net-zero emissions by 2070.
5.  **Risk Management & Compliance:** Strengthening assurance frameworks, predictive analytics for EWS, real-time transaction monitoring, and robust cybersecurity through the Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (CCoE). Adherence to macro-prudential norms from RBI.
6.  **Human Capital:** HR Transformation via "Ekam" project for digital HR tools, talent pool strengthening, and DEI initiatives. "Union SWAR" program for employee well-being.
7.  **Operational Excellence (EASE Reforms):** Improving branch banking experience, enhancing customer self-service, digital lending, unified call centre experience, and automation.
