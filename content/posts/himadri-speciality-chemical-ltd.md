**Important Note:**  The Consolidated figures include the liabilities of Himadri's subsidiaries. The Standalone figures represent only Himadri's own liabilities.  There's a difference in Accounts Payable between the standalone and consolidated figures which is to be expected due to intercompany eliminations.  The long-term debt figure includes lease liabilities, so the pure long-term debt would be slightly lower.  Specific numbers for  pure long-term debt would require a more detailed breakdown of the financial statements.

### Equity Analysis
Here's the breakdown of shareholders' equity, retained earnings, and share capital for Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd., based on the provided annual report (amounts in Indian Rupees in Lakhs):

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹2,98,120.99
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹1,63,864.25
* **Share Capital:** ₹4,925.95


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹3,04,278.09 (This includes equity attributable to owners of the company and deducts non-controlling interests.)

* **Diluted EPS:** ₹9.16

**Important Note:** The Consolidated figures reflect the performance of the entire group, including subsidiaries.  The Standalone figures pertain only to Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd. The minor differences between the Standalone and Consolidated figures result from the consolidation process which includes intercompany eliminations and adjustments.  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is often used as a proxy for operating cash flow.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Here's a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows for Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd. from the provided annual report (amounts in Indian Rupees in Lakhs):

**Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:**

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹40,475.89
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(40,486.49)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹718.66


**Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:**

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹40,035.39
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(40,512.24)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹812.18


**Important Note:**  The Consolidated figures incorporate the cash flows from all subsidiaries within the group.  The Standalone figures represent only Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd.'s cash flows. The negative cash flow from investing activities in both statements is primarily due to significant investments made during the year.  The positive cash flow from financing activities reflects proceeds from equity share issuances and warrant conversions, partially offset by debt repayments and dividend payments.



### Cash Flow Metrics
The provided annual report doesn't explicitly state "Free Cash Flow" as a separate line item.  Free cash flow is a calculated metric, not always directly presented.  However, we can approximate it and find the other values you requested:

**Approximating Free Cash Flow:**

Free Cash Flow (FCF) is generally calculated as:

FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures + Proceeds from sale of fixed assets

Based on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹40,475.89 Lakhs
* **Capital Expenditures:** ₹(5,236.08 Lakhs) *Note: This is the net figure after accounting for proceeds from asset sales.*
* **Proceeds from sale of fixed assets:** ₹10.55 Lakhs

Therefore, an *approximation* of Consolidated Free Cash Flow would be:

FCF ≈ ₹40,475.89 Lakhs - ₹(5,236.08 Lakhs) + ₹10.55 Lakhs ≈ ₹35,240.36 Lakhs

A similar calculation can be done for the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows using the respective figures.  This is still an approximation as certain other cash outflows (e.g.,  working capital changes) might also be considered in a more precise FCF calculation.

**Capital Expenditure:**

* **Consolidated:**  The net capital expenditure (after accounting for proceeds from asset sales) is reported as ₹(5,236.08) Lakhs.  The gross capital expenditure would be higher as this number is net of asset sales.
* **Standalone:** The net capital expenditure (after accounting for proceeds from asset sales) is reported as ₹(5,236.08) Lakhs.

**Dividends Paid:**

* **Consolidated:** ₹1,081.95 Lakhs
* **Standalone:** ₹1,081.95 Lakhs (Note that dividends paid are the same for both as it only relates to the Holding Company)


Remember that these figures are based on the information directly provided in the report.  A precise free cash flow calculation often requires adjustments not explicitly stated in the financial statements.



## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
Here's a calculation of the profitability ratios for Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd., using data from the provided annual report.  Remember that these are based on the reported figures and the definitions used within the report.  Slight variations might occur depending on the precise definitions used.  Note also that the Consolidated figures encompass the entire group, while the Standalone figures represent Himadri's performance alone.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹4,18,489.03 Lakhs
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹3,07,184.52 Lakhs
* **Gross Profit:** ₹1,11,304.51 Lakhs
* **Operating Income (EBIT):** ₹57,313.74 Lakhs
* **Net Income:** ₹41,099.54 Lakhs
* **Average Shareholders' Equity:** ₹2,21,560.10 Lakhs (This is an approximation, assuming the beginning and ending equity are equally weighted.  The precise average will vary slightly based on the calculation method.)
* **Average Total Assets:** ₹3,60,691.45 Lakhs (Same assumptions as for equity)


* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (111304.51 / 418489.03) * 100 ≈ 26.6%
* **Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (57313.74 / 418489.03) * 100 ≈ 13.7%
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (41099.54 / 418489.03) * 100 ≈ 9.8%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (41099.54 / 221560.10) * 100 ≈ 18.5%
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (41099.54 / 360691.45) * 100 ≈ 11.4%


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹4,18,489.03 Lakhs
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹3,06,697.60 Lakhs
* **Gross Profit:** ₹1,11,791.43 Lakhs
* **Operating Income (EBIT):** ₹57,385.61 Lakhs
* **Net Income:** ₹41,068.18 Lakhs
* **Average Shareholders' Equity:** ₹2,27,769.13 Lakhs (Approximation, assuming equal weighting of beginning and ending equity.)
* **Average Total Assets:** ₹3,67,812.90 Lakhs (Same assumptions as for equity)


* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (111791.43 / 418489.03) * 100 ≈ 26.7%
* **Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (57385.61 / 418489.03) * 100 ≈ 13.7%
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (41068.18 / 418489.03) * 100 ≈ 9.8%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (41068.18 / 227769.13) * 100 ≈ 18.0%
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (41068.18 / 367812.90) * 100 ≈ 11.2%


Again, these are approximations.  Refer to the financial statements for the precise figures and calculation methodologies used by the company.  The slight differences between the standalone and consolidated ratios are due to the inclusion of subsidiary data in the consolidated statements.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate the liquidity ratios for Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd., we need certain values from the balance sheet which are not explicitly stated in the readily available text.  However, I can guide you on how to calculate them using the information provided earlier, and show you where the necessary information can be found in the full financial statements.

**Liquidity Ratios:**

These ratios assess a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.  They are calculated as follows:


* **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities

    *   To calculate this, you'll need the total current assets and total current liabilities from the balance sheet for both the Standalone and Consolidated statements.  These values were stated earlier in the report.

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities

    *   Similar to the current ratio, you'll need total current assets and current liabilities.  You'll also need the inventory value from the balance sheet, which was also provided earlier.

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities

    *  This requires the cash and cash equivalents value and current liabilities from the balance sheet. These values were provided earlier in the report.



**Where to Find the Data:**

The necessary figures (Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Inventories, and Cash & Cash Equivalents) are all presented in the Standalone and Consolidated Balance Sheets within the annual report.  You can substitute those values into the formulas provided above.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:**  Remember to calculate these ratios separately for both the Standalone (Himadri's own financials) and Consolidated (including subsidiaries) financial statements.
* **Approximations:** Since the exact figures are not directly given here, any calculation using the earlier stated values will be approximations.  Refer to the complete annual report for precise values.
* **Industry Benchmarks:** It's essential to compare these calculated ratios to industry averages or benchmarks to effectively assess Himadri's liquidity position relative to its competitors.

Once you obtain the precise figures from the balance sheet, you can directly input them into the above formulas to generate the exact liquidity ratios.

### Efficiency Ratios
To compute the efficiency ratios for Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd., we need data from both the income statement and the balance sheet.  The necessary data was provided earlier, but for accurate calculations you should refer to the complete financial statements provided in the annual report.  Here's how to calculate these ratios and the sources of the necessary data:

**Efficiency Ratios:**

These ratios gauge how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales.  The calculations are as follows:


* **Asset Turnover:** Net Sales / Average Total Assets

    *   **Net Sales:**  This is the revenue from operations figure from the income statement.
    *   **Average Total Assets:** (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2. You need the total assets from the beginning and end of the reporting period (found in the balance sheet for both standalone and consolidated statements.)

* **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory

    *   **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**  This is found on the income statement.  In the provided report, this data is presented as "Cost of Materials Consumed," which is often similar to COGS but may have slight differences based on specific accounting treatments.
    *   **Average Inventory:** (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2. You need the beginning and ending inventory values from the balance sheet.

* **Receivables Turnover:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable

    *   **Net Credit Sales:** This isn't directly stated but might be approximated using total revenue assuming most sales are on credit (which you would need to verify in the annual report).
    *   **Average Accounts Receivable:** (Beginning Accounts Receivable + Ending Accounts Receivable) / 2.  Obtain these values from the balance sheet. Remember the provided values were *net* of allowance for doubtful debts. Using gross receivables would provide a slightly different calculation.


**Where to Find the Data:**

* **Income Statement:** Provides Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold (or Cost of Materials Consumed).
* **Balance Sheet:** Provides Beginning and Ending values for Total Assets, Inventory, and Accounts Receivable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:** Calculate these ratios separately for both the Standalone and Consolidated financial statements to obtain a complete picture.
* **Approximations:** The values provided earlier are rounded and may lead to some inaccuracies in ratio calculations.   Use the precise values from the financial statements in the annual report for more accurate results.
* **Industry Averages:** Compare the calculated ratios to industry benchmarks to gain a better understanding of Himadri's efficiency relative to its peers.
* **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):**  While not explicitly requested, these related metrics provide valuable insights.  They can be easily computed using the turnover ratios:
    *   DSO = 365 / Receivables Turnover
    *   DIO = 365 / Inventory Turnover


Once you've obtained the precise data from the complete annual report, you can plug the values into the formulas above to get your answers.  Remember to clearly state whether your calculations use standalone or consolidated data.


### Leverage Ratios
To compute the use ratios for Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd., we'll use data from both the balance sheet and the income statement. The necessary data points were provided previously, but for precise calculations, always refer to the complete financial statements in the annual report. Here's how to calculate these ratios, along with the data sources:


**Leverage Ratios:**

These ratios measure a company's financial risk or its ability to pay its debts.  The calculations are:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity

    *   **Total Debt:** This encompasses both current and non-current liabilities excluding items that aren't debt (such as trade payables).  You'll need the relevant figures from the balance sheet.
    *   **Total Shareholders' Equity:** Found on the balance sheet for both standalone and consolidated statements.


* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets

    *   **Total Debt:** As defined above.
    *   **Total Assets:**  Found on the balance sheet.


* **Interest Coverage Ratio (Times Interest Earned):** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense

    *   **EBIT:**  This is often called "Operating Income" and is found on the income statement.  It's calculated as Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses.
    *   **Interest Expense:** Found on the income statement under Finance Costs.


**Where to Find the Data:**

*   **Balance Sheet:**  Provides Total Debt (current and non-current liabilities – excluding non-debt items), Total Shareholders’ Equity, and Total Assets.
*   **Income Statement:** Provides EBIT (Operating Income) and Interest Expense (Finance Costs).


**Important Considerations:**

*   **Standalone vs. Consolidated:** Remember to calculate these ratios separately for both the Standalone and Consolidated financial statements for a detailed understanding.
*   **Approximations:** Earlier provided values were rounded. Use precise data from the complete annual report for better accuracy.
*   **Industry Benchmarks:** Comparing the calculated ratios to industry averages gives context to Himadri's use and financial risk.
*   **Debt Definition:** The precise definition of "Total Debt" can vary. Ensure consistency with the definitions employed in the financial statements.  Some companies may include lease obligations within their debt calculations.

Once you have the precise values from the financial statements, substitute them into the formulas. Clearly indicate whether you used standalone or consolidated data for each calculation.





## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
Calculating these market-based ratios requires information beyond what's directly available in the provided annual report text.  Specifically, we need the current market price per share and the number of outstanding shares to calculate the market capitalization.  The report only provides data as of the end of the fiscal year, not the current market situation.   I can show you how to calculate these ratios once you provide the necessary market data.


**Market-Based Ratios:**

These ratios provide insights into how the market values a company relative to its financials.  Here are the calculations:

* **Market Capitalization:** Current Market Price per Share * Number of Outstanding Shares

    *   **Current Market Price per Share:** You need the *current* share price from a financial website (such as Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg).  The share price at the *end* of the fiscal year is not sufficient.
    *   **Number of Outstanding Shares:** This is usually provided in the annual report (often in the Shareholder Information section).  The report you provided has this data.

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)

    *   **Current Market Price per Share:**  As above.
    *   **EPS:**  Earnings per share (both basic and diluted) are provided in the annual report.  Use the most relevant one (usually basic EPS).

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):** Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share

    *   **Current Market Price per Share:** As above.
    *   **Book Value per Share:** Total Shareholders' Equity / Number of Outstanding Shares.  You can find the total shareholder's equity on the balance sheet.

* **Dividend Yield:** Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share

    *   **Annual Dividend per Share:**  The annual dividend is stated in the report.
    *   **Current Market Price per Share:** As above.

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** Annual Dividends / Net Income

    *   **Annual Dividends:** The total dividends paid are provided in the report. You can then calculate the dividend per share.
    *   **Net Income:** Found in the income statement.


**Where to Find the Data:**

*   **Annual Report:** Provides the number of outstanding shares and the annual dividend per share and the net income.
*   **Financial Website:** Provides the current market price per share.


**How to Calculate Once You Have the Market Data:**

1.  **Obtain the current market price per share** for Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd. from a reputable financial website.
2.  **Use the number of outstanding shares** from the annual report.
3.  **Calculate the market capitalization** using the formula above.
4.  **Use the EPS and PB values** from the annual report and the current market price to calculate the PE and PB ratios.
5.  **Use the dividend per share and the market price** to calculate the dividend yield.
6.  **Use the total dividends paid and the net income** to compute the dividend payout ratio.


Remember to clearly specify whether your calculations are based on basic or diluted EPS.  Always use the *current* market price and clearly state the date you obtained it for context.





## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The Himadri Speciality Chemical Ltd. annual report does not provide a complete breakdown of segment performance with all the specifics you requested (market share, precise geographic presence).  The report provides segment information at a higher level, with some details missing.  I can give you the information that *is* available, along with what's missing:


**Business Segments:**

Himadri operates in many interconnected segments within the specialty chemicals and materials industry. The report emphasizes these key areas, but precise data for each aspect is limited:


1.  **Battery Materials:** This is a high-growth segment for Himadri, driven by the global push towards electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS).  Himadri is strategically investing in this space, as shown by its investments in Sicona Battery Technologies and Invati Creations.  However, the report does *not* provide revenue, growth rate, or market share figures for this specific segment. Key products are anode materials, silicon-based anode materials, and cathode materials. Geographic presence is not specified in the report.

2.  **Carbon Black:**  A core business for Himadri.  The report highlights a planned capacity expansion and the introduction of new product lines (ONYX, JETEX, ELECTRA, KLAREX, COLORX, BARONX, VIRTEX) targeting various applications.   While total revenue is given for the company, the revenue specifically attributable to carbon black is *not* broken out. Growth rates and market share are also not detailed for this segment. The report does not explicitly indicate geographic presence but implies a broad global reach.


3.  **Coal Tar Pitch:** This is a significant segment, though the report does not provide a separate revenue or growth rate. The key product is Coal Tar Pitch, serving aluminium and graphite electrode industries. Geographic presence is again not specifically outlined.


4.  **Naphthalene & Related Products:** This includes refined naphthalene and SNF (sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde). Again, individual revenue is not provided.  The report states that the textile industry is a leading end-user, implying strong domestic presence, but further details of its revenue, growth, market share, and international presence are not specified.


5.  **Specialty Oils:**  Derived from coal tar distillation. No separate revenue or growth rate is provided for this segment.  Information on market share and geographic presence is also absent from the report.


6.  **Tyres:** A new business segment following the acquisition of Birla Tyres. Revenue, growth rate, market share, and specific geographic presence are not detailed for this segment in the current report.


**Missing Information:**

The annual report lacks essential data for a detailed segmental analysis:

*   **Segment-Specific Revenue:**  The report does not present a detailed revenue breakdown for each segment.
*   **Growth Rates:**  Year-on-year or other growth figures are largely absent for individual segments.
*   **Operating Margins:** The report provides overall operating margins but not a segment-by-segment breakdown.
