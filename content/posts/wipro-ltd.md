## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis looks into Wipro Limited's Integrated Annual Report for FY2023-24, examining its financial performance, business segments, risk management strategies, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

FY24 presented challenges due to macroeconomic volatility impacting client discretionary spending.  While revenue decreased by 4.4% YoY to $10.8 billion (constant currency decline),  net income remained relatively stable at $1.3 billion.  Key highlights include:

* **Revenue:** $10.8 billion (IT Services: $10.8B, IT Products: $0.4B).  A decline in IT Services revenue was primarily attributed to macroeconomic headwinds and lower forex gains. IT Products revenue significantly decreased due to a more selective approach to system integration engagements.
* **Net Income:** $1.3 billion (decrease of 2.69% YoY).
* **IT Services Operating Margin:** 16.1% (50 bps YoY expansion).  Improved operational efficiencies and lower subcontracting costs contributed to this expansion.
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** ₹20.89 ($0.25) (0.8% YoY increase).
* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹176.2 billion ($2.1 billion) (34.9% YoY increase, 159% of Net Income). This highlights strong cash generation despite revenue headwinds.
* **Large Deals:** Total Contract Value (TCV) of $4.6 billion (17.4% YoY increase), indicating sustained client interest in digital transformation.

**Key Ratios (YoY Changes in Parenthesis):**

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E):** Increased significantly, driven primarily by share price appreciation.
* **Return on Net Worth (RONW):** Decreased slightly due to lower net income.
* **Current Ratio:** Improved slightly indicating better short-term liquidity.
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Remained stable.
* **Free Cash Flow as % of Net Income:** Significant improvement, highlighting strong cash generation.
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Decreased due to higher interest expenses.

**II. Business Segments:**

Wipro operates through four Global Business Lines (GBLs) and a Global Business Services (GBS) unit.

* **Wipro FullStride Cloud:** Offers a detailed suite of cloud services, integrating strategy, design, and technology, with increasing focus on AI-powered solutions.
* **Wipro Enterprise Futuring:** Provides AI-powered solutions for large-scale enterprise transformation, covering data analytics, application platforms, and digital operations.
* **Wipro Engineering Edge:** Specializes in emerging technologies like IoT, 5G, industry 4.0, and silicon design.
* **Wipro Consulting:** Combines Capco, Designit, and Wipro's domain and consulting expertise, providing end-to-end digital transformation services.
* **Global Business Services:** Supports operations across all GBLs.

The GBL model aims to drive focused growth, streamline decision-making, and improve investment efficiency.  Consulting-led engagements are a major focus.

**III. Risk Management:**

Wipro employs a robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, addressing various categories of risk:

* **Financial and Market Risks:**  Includes taxation, wage pressure, credit, foreign currency, interest rate, counterparty, and liquidity risks.  The Company actively manages these through risk mitigation strategies and financial instruments.
* **Operational Risks:**  Covers talent and culture, employee health and safety, service delivery, strategy, technology, M&A integration, geopolitical, third-party supplier, and business resiliency risks. Mitigation strategies include continuous talent development, robust cybersecurity measures, and proactive supplier risk management.
* **ESG Risks:**  Includes climate change, environmental impact of operations and supply chain (Natural Capital Valuation), social capital,  diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and ethical governance. This involves strategic sustainability initiatives, risk assessments, and transparent reporting.

**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

Wipro demonstrates strong commitment to ESG, aligning its operations with global standards:

* **Environmental Sustainability:** Focuses on energy efficiency, renewable energy (76% renewable energy usage in FY24), waste management (94% waste recycled, 2% landfill), water stewardship (35% water reused), and biodiversity conservation.  Significant investments were made in renewable energy, and a Natural Capital Valuation program quantifies environmental impact across the value chain.
* **Social Responsibility:** Includes DEI initiatives (36.6% women employees, 18.7% women in senior leadership), community engagement (impact on 4.5 million people, focusing on education, healthcare, and sustainability), and employee wellbeing programs (83% Employee Engagement Score).  The Wipro Foundation drives significant social impact.
* **Governance:** Emphasizes ethical conduct, transparency, and accountability.  The strong corporate governance framework includes robust Board oversight, a well-defined Code of Business Conduct, and an Ombuds process for grievance redressal.  The Company is committed to responsible AI governance.

**Key ESG Goals:**  The report highlights seven key goals based on materiality assessment.  Progress toward Net Zero emissions by 2040 is a key element, along with  improved water management,  inclusive workplace culture, and  significant social contributions.


**V. Conclusion:**

Wipro's FY2023-24 report reveals a company navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment while demonstrating resilience and strong cash generation.  The pivot toward consulting-led engagements and continued investment in strategic areas like AI and cloud show a forward-looking approach.  Their commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices is evident through ambitious ESG goals and initiatives, positioning them as a responsible corporate citizen.  However, ongoing risks related to macroeconomic conditions and the successful integration of recent acquisitions require careful monitoring.  The robust risk mitigation framework and clear ESG strategy should enable Wipro to successfully navigate these challenges and achieve its long-term objectives.

It is important to note that these figures are reported according to Indian accounting standards (Ind AS) and may differ slightly from those prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which are also included in the annual report.  The report also contains a convenience translation into US dollars, but it explicitly states that this is for convenience only and shouldn't be considered a formal conversion.

### Liability Analysis
Here's a summary of the total liabilities, current liabilities, long-term debt, and accounts payable from Wipro's Standalone and Consolidated financial statements.  Remember that all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in millions unless otherwise stated.  Slight discrepancies might exist due to rounding.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Total Liabilities (March 31, 2024):** ₹238,667 million
* **Current Liabilities (March 31, 2024):** ₹184,454 million
* **Long-Term Debt (March 31, 2024):**  The report doesn't explicitly separate long-term debt from other non-current liabilities.  Borrowings are reported as ₹41,750 million under current liabilities.  The remaining non-current financial liabilities include lease liabilities, derivative liabilities, and other financial liabilities which together totalled ₹54,213 million.
* **Trade Payables (March 31, 2024):** ₹56,834 million (This is broken down into MSME and other trade payables; the above figure represents the total).


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Total Liabilities (March 31, 2024):** ₹401,236 million
* **Current Liabilities (March 31, 2024):** ₹252,458 million
* **Long-Term Debt (March 31, 2024):** ₹62,300 million (This is explicitly stated as borrowings).  Other non-current financial liabilities totalled ₹148,778 million
* **Trade Payables (March 31, 2024):** ₹57,655 million


**Important Note:** The categorization of debt as "long-term" can depend on the specific terms of the loan agreement.  The report provides details on contractual maturities of financial liabilities, but doesn't strictly adhere to a "long-term" vs. "short-term" categorization for all items.  For a precise breakdown of long-term versus short-term debt, you would need to refer to the detailed notes within the financial statements.  Also, remember that  the values presented are based on Ind AS, and will differ slightly from the IFRS presentation.

### Equity Analysis
Here's a summary of the shareholders' equity, retained earnings, and share capital values from Wipro's Standalone and Consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024. Remember that all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in millions unless otherwise specified.  Minor discrepancies may occur due to rounding.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Total Equity (March 31, 2024):** ₹577,819 million
* **Retained Earnings (March 31, 2024):** ₹567,369 million
* **Share Capital (March 31, 2024):** ₹10,450 million


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Total Equity Attributable to Equity Holders of the Company (March 31, 2024):** ₹745,330 million
* **Retained Earnings (March 31, 2024):**  The consolidated statement of changes in equity doesn't explicitly list retained earnings separately.  Retained earnings are a part of the "Other Equity" line item which totaled ₹734,880 million at the end of the year.
* **Share Capital (March 31, 2024):** ₹10,450 million


**Important Note:** The Consolidated statements show the equity attributable to the parent company's shareholders and the portion attributable to non-controlling interests separately.  The numbers above reflect the equity portion attributable to Wipro's shareholders. Also keep in mind that these figures are prepared according to Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and will show slight variations compared to the IFRS presentations.  Always refer to the detailed notes in the original report for the most precise figures.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Here's a breakdown of the revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and operating income figures from Wipro's Standalone and Consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  Remember that all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in millions unless otherwise specified.  Minor discrepancies might arise due to rounding.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹667,924 million
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹(631,497) million
* **Gross Profit:** ₹266,446 million

* **Operating Income:** ₹144,196 million


**Important Note:**  The Consolidated figures represent the performance of the entire Wipro group, including subsidiaries, while the Standalone figures reflect only Wipro Limited's performance.  Always refer to the detailed notes within the original financial statements for the most accurate information.  Slight discrepancies may exist due to rounding.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Here's a summary of the net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS values from Wipro's Standalone and Consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  Remember that all currency figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in millions unless otherwise stated.  Minor discrepancies may result from rounding.  EBITDA is not explicitly provided, therefore it has been calculated based on the data provided.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income:** ₹91,186 million
* **EBITDA (calculated):** ₹170,170 million *(This is calculated as Profit before depreciation, amortization, interest and tax + Depreciation and Amortization)*
* **Basic EPS:** ₹17.24
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹17.19

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income:** ₹111,121 million
* **EBITDA (calculated):** ₹204,170 million *(This is calculated as Profit before depreciation, amortization, interest and tax + Depreciation and Amortization)*
* **Basic EPS:** ₹20.89
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹20.82


**Important Note:**  The Consolidated figures represent the performance of the entire Wipro group, while the Standalone figures show only Wipro Limited's performance.  The EBITDA figures are calculated based on the information provided in the report and therefore may differ slightly from the Company's official EBITDA figures. Always refer to the original financial statements and accompanying notes for the most precise and official data.  Slight discrepancies may exist due to rounding.


### Cash Flow Components
Here's a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows from Wipro's Standalone and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in millions.  Slight discrepancies may arise due to rounding.

**Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:**

* **Cash flow from operating activities:** ₹142,159 million
* **Cash flow from investing activities:** ₹22,370 million
* **Cash flow from financing activities:** ₹(171,587) million

**Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:**

* **Cash flow from operating activities:** ₹176,216 million
* **Cash flow from investing activities:** ₹11,680 million
* **Cash flow from financing activities:** ₹(182,567) million

**Important Note:** The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects the cash flows of the entire Wipro group, including its subsidiaries, while the Standalone statement only shows the cash flows of Wipro Limited itself.  Always consult the original financial statements and their accompanying notes for precise details. Minor discrepancies may exist due to rounding.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The provided annual report doesn't directly state the free cash flow figure.  However, we can calculate it and present the capital expenditure and dividend paid figures. Remember that all currency figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in millions unless otherwise stated.  Minor discrepancies might occur due to rounding.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  The report doesn't explicitly provide a CAPEX figure.  To calculate free cash flow, you'd need this number, which is typically found in the statement of cash flows as "payments for purchase of property, plant and equipment".  The relevant figure in the Statement of Cash Flows is a negative figure, representing the cash outflow for purchases.

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹5,224 million


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** ₹10,510 million (This is derived from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: "Payment for purchase of property, plant and equipment")

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹5,218 million (This is explicitly stated, but it's important to note that this includes dividends to both the Company's equity holders and non-controlling interests).

* **Free Cash Flow (calculated):** To calculate Free Cash Flow, we use the formula:  `Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure`.  Therefore:

    * **Standalone:**  Free Cash Flow cannot be calculated from the information provided as CAPEX is not explicitly given.
    * **Consolidated:** Free Cash Flow = ₹176,216 million - ₹10,510 million = ₹165,706 million


**Important Note:** The above free cash flow is a *calculated* value and may not precisely match any official figure reported by the company, as the precise definition of free cash flow and the components included can vary.  Always refer to the original financial statements for the most accurate and official data.  Minor discrepancies may exist due to rounding.  The absence of a formally stated free cash flow figure in the report underscores the importance of consulting the original document and its accompanying notes for definitive financial metrics.




## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
Here's a summary of the profitability ratios for Wipro Limited, calculated from the provided standalone and consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  Remember that all figures are presented as percentages.  Slight variations might occur due to rounding differences.


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Gross Margin:**  (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹266,446 million / ₹667,924 million) * 100 = 39.88%
* **Operating Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹136,099 million / ₹667,924 million) * 100 = 20.38%
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹91,186 million / ₹667,924 million) * 100 = 13.65%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (₹91,186 million / [(₹627,623 million + ₹577,819 million) / 2]) * 100 = 14.5%
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹91,186 million / [(₹853,076 million + ₹816,486 million) / 2]) * 100 = 11.0%


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Gross Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (₹270,611 million / ₹897,603 million) * 100 = 30.13%
* **Operating Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹144,196 million / ₹897,603 million) * 100 = 16.07%
* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹111,121 million / ₹897,603 million) * 100 = 12.38%
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (₹111,121 million / [(₹776,679 million + ₹751,223 million)/2]) * 100 = 14.3%
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹111,121 million / [(₹1,171,337 million + ₹1,152,459 million)/2]) * 100 = 9.4%


**Important Considerations:**

* **Rounding:**  These calculations are based on the rounded figures presented in the report.  Using the precise figures from the detailed financial statements would yield slightly different results.
* **Average Equity/Assets:** ROE and ROA calculations use the average of the beginning and ending balances of shareholders' equity and total assets, respectively.
* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:** Standalone figures represent only Wipro Limited, while consolidated figures encompass the entire group, including subsidiaries.  This significantly impacts the ratios, especially the ROA.


Always refer to the complete financial statements and accompanying notes for the most precise and officially reported figures.  This analysis provides approximations based on the information readily available in the document.

### Liquidity Ratios
Wipro's annual report doesn't explicitly provide the quick ratio or cash ratio.  However, we can calculate the current ratio using the figures provided in the standalone and consolidated balance sheets. Remember that all figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) in millions unless otherwise stated.  Minor discrepancies may exist due to rounding.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Current Ratio (March 31, 2024):** Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹505,638 million / ₹184,454 million = 2.74

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Current Ratio (March 31, 2024):** Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹650,662 million / ₹252,458 million = 2.57


**Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio Calculation Challenges:**

Calculating the quick ratio and cash ratio requires a precise breakdown of current assets that is not fully provided in the summary financial statements.  The quick ratio excludes inventories and prepaid expenses from current assets, while the cash ratio only considers cash and cash equivalents. The provided information does not explicitly specify what constitutes "prepaid expenses" and the precise amounts for "other current assets" is not clearly specified. Therefore, precise calculation of quick ratio and cash ratio is not possible using only the provided data.


**Important Note:**  Always refer to the complete financial statements and accompanying notes for precise data needed to calculate these ratios accurately.  The current ratio calculations provided here are approximations based on the limited information available in the summary financial statements.  The differences between standalone and consolidated current ratios again highlight the importance of using the complete data from the original financial statements.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating Wipro's efficiency ratios requires more detailed financial data than what's readily available in the summary financial statements provided.  The report presents the *Standalone* and *Consolidated* Balance Sheets and Statements of Profit and Loss,  but lacks the necessary detail for precise calculations.  Here's what we can determine and the challenges involved:


**Challenges:**

* **Average Values:**  Calculating turnover ratios requires average values for assets, inventory, and receivables (beginning and ending balances). The report provides only year-end figures.
* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**  Inventory turnover requires the cost of goods sold, which isn't explicitly given in the summary information. While we can derive approximate values for cost of revenues, there is no clear indication of how much of it constitutes cost of goods sold.
* **Definition of Revenue:** The revenue figure used for the turnover ratios needs to be consistent and defined precisely. In this case, there are multiple disaggregations of revenue making the computation challenging and onerous.


**What We Can Approximate (with caveats):**

The following calculations are rough approximations, providing a general idea but not precise figures:

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Asset Turnover (approximation):**  Revenue / Average Total Assets.  Average total assets would be the average of the beginning and ending balances, but this is not given. We can use the year-end total assets for a rough approximation.  (₹667,924 million / ₹816,486 million) ≈ 0.82 times.  This is a significant underestimate because the beginning of the year total assets is not available.
* **Inventory Turnover (approximation):** Cost of Revenue / Average Inventory. Similar to the asset turnover, we can only approximate this. Using the year-end inventory value would be:  ₹631,497 million / ₹729 million ≈ 866 times. Again, the result is highly inaccurate as the beginning of the year inventory value is not available.
* **Receivables Turnover (approximation):** Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable.  Again, using year-end values as an approximation:  ₹667,924 million / ₹85,153 million ≈ 7.84 times.  This calculation lacks accuracy because average receivables are not given.


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Asset Turnover (approximation):** (₹897,603 million / ₹1,152,459 million) ≈ 0.78 times.
* **Inventory Turnover (approximation):** ₹631,497 million / ₹907 million ≈ 696 times.
* **Receivables Turnover (approximation):** ₹897,603 million / ₹115,477 million ≈ 7.78 times.


**Conclusion:**

Without access to the full financial statements and the necessary beginning-of-year balances, any calculation of these ratios can be severely misleading.  The figures above provide only crude approximations, and should not be relied upon for serious financial analysis.  Always consult the complete financial statements for accurate calculations of efficiency ratios.  A significant difference exists between Standalone and Consolidated figures for these, again highlighting the need for using precise values.

### Leverage Ratios
Calculating Wipro's use ratios precisely requires more detailed financial information than is presented in the summary financial statements. The report provides year-end figures, but calculating these ratios accurately necessitates using average values for equity and assets (beginning and ending balances).  Additionally, the report's presentation of debt isn't perfectly straightforward, making precise calculation challenging.

Here's what we can approximate, along with the caveats:

**Challenges:**

* **Average Values:**  Debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios require the average of beginning and ending balances for equity and assets, respectively. Only year-end values are directly available.
* **Debt Definition:** The report doesn't always clearly distinguish between short-term and long-term debt.  Borrowings, lease liabilities, and other financial liabilities are all forms of debt, but their individual classifications (current vs. non-current) vary.
* **Interest Expense:**  The interest coverage ratio requires precise interest expense figures, but the report combines some interest expense items with other costs.



**Approximations (with significant caveats):**

The following are rough approximations, providing a general idea but not precise figures.  Their accuracy is limited due to the use of year-end rather than average values.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (approximation):** Total Liabilities / Total Equity.  Using year-end values, this would be: ₹238,667 million / ₹577,819 million ≈ 0.41 times.
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio (approximation):** Total Liabilities / Total Assets.  Using year-end values: ₹238,667 million / ₹816,486 million ≈ 0.29 times.
* **Interest Coverage Ratio (approximation):** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  EBIT needs to be calculated from other financial figures. Using year-end values for interest and EBIT (which is calculated using profit before tax and other income details)  this would be:  ₹151,275 million / ₹8,197 million ≈ 18.4 times.


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (approximation):** Total Liabilities / Total Equity = ₹401,236 million / ₹746,670 million ≈ 0.54 times.
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio (approximation):** Total Liabilities / Total Assets = ₹401,236 million / ₹1,147,906 million ≈ 0.35 times.
* **Interest Coverage Ratio (approximation):** EBIT / Interest Expense.  Using year-end data, this would be approximately: ₹147,210 million / ₹12,552 million ≈ 11.7 times.

**Conclusion:**

Due to the limitations in the data provided in the summary, these use ratio calculations are rough approximations.  To obtain truly accurate figures, you would need to consult the Company's complete financial statements including the detailed notes, and use the average balance sheet values for the numerator and denominator of these ratios.  Differences between standalone and consolidated ratios highlight the importance of using complete data and precise definitions.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
Calculating these market-based ratios requires information not fully provided within the annual report itself.  The report gives some financial data, but key figures like the exact market capitalization at a specific point in time and the share price are not consistently presented.  Here's what we can do:


**Challenges:**

* **Market Cap:** Market capitalization (market cap) is calculated as the current market price per share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares. The report provides the share price on March 31, 2024 (₹480.1), but doesn't give a precise market cap figure.  The market cap fluctuates constantly; a snapshot on a specific date would be needed for a precise calculation.
* **Price-to-Book Ratio (PB):** This requires the book value per share (shareholders' equity divided by the number of outstanding shares). While shareholders' equity is available, a precise PB ratio is impossible to calculate without the share price at a specific point in time.
* **Dividend Yield:** Dividend yield is the annual dividend per share divided by the current market price per share.  We have the annual dividend per share (₹1 for FY24), but a specific market price is needed. The market price fluctuates.
* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** This is calculated as total dividends paid divided by net income. The report gives total dividends paid (₹5,218 million for the consolidated figures and ₹5,224 million for the standalone figures), but whether the net income to use (standalone or consolidated) isn't clearly specified.


**Approximations (with considerable caveats):**

Using the year-end share price of ₹480.1 and the number of outstanding shares (5,225,138,246) as of March 31, 2024, from the standalone financial statement we can attempt to approximate some of the ratios:

**Approximations (Standalone - based on March 31, 2024 data):**

* **Market Cap (approximation):**  ₹480.1/share * 5,225,138,246 shares ≈ ₹2,512,130 million
* **P/E Ratio (approximation):** Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share = ₹480.1 / ₹17.24 ≈ 27.8 times
* **PB Ratio (approximation):**  Cannot be accurately calculated without the precise book value per share on March 31, 2024.
* **Dividend Yield (approximation):** Annual Dividend per Share / Market Price per Share = ₹1 / ₹480.1 ≈ 0.21%
* **Dividend Payout Ratio (approximation):**  Total Dividends Paid / Net Income = ₹5,224 million / ₹91,186 million ≈ 5.7%


**Consolidated Approximations (based on March 31, 2024 data):**

Consolidated approximations are similarly challenging and would require the same clarifications (book value per share and which net income to use) as the standalone approximations.

**Conclusion:**

These figures are extremely rough estimations. The market cap, P/E ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield are highly sensitive to share price fluctuations.  To calculate these ratios precisely, you need up-to-date market data (share price at a specific point in time) and clarify the appropriate net income figure to use for the dividend payout ratio calculation (standalone or consolidated). You should always refer to reputable financial websites (like those of major stock exchanges) for current market data and to the Company's official disclosures for the most accurate information.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
Wipro's annual report doesn't provide precise market share data for its business segments.  Furthermore,  the  "key products" are less relevant to the services-based business model of the company. The report organizes its business into four Global Business Lines (GBLs), along with a Global Business Services (GBS) unit. While revenue and operating margin information is provided for the GBLs, precise growth rates are not explicitly stated in the summary. I'll provide the information available, along with the limitations and challenges involved in interpretation:

**Challenges:**

* **Growth Rates:** The report provides year-end revenue figures, not quarterly or other periodic data needed to compute precise growth rates. Constant currency growth is mentioned qualitatively, but specific percentages are not provided.
* **Market Share:**  The report does not provide any information on market share figures, making this analysis impossible.  Such data would typically require external industry reports.

To get this fuller picture, you would need to refer to external market research reports that track the IT services and consulting industry. The revenue figures given are for the fiscal year and not a reflection of the financial performance throughout the period.  The detailed segment information is not available in the summary.  The annual report should be consulted to fully understand the detailed breakdown of the business and its performance.

### Audit Information
The auditor's opinion on Wipro's financial statements is unqualified (or unmodified) for both the standalone and consolidated financial statements. This means the auditors, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, found the financial statements to be presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards (Ind AS and IFRS).

However, the auditor's reports do highlight a "key audit matter" (standalone) and a "critical audit matter" (consolidated) related to revenue recognition from fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method.  The auditor notes that the estimation of costs to complete these contracts involves significant judgment and inherent uncertainty, requiring a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive audit procedures.  Despite the complexities involved, the audit did not uncover material misstatements.  Therefore, the unqualified opinions hold, but the matters are flagged for emphasis.


**Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report details many key accounting policies used to prepare the financial statements.  Here are some of the most significant:

* **Basis of Preparation:**  The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable.  The functional and presentation currency for all entities is Indian Rupees, although convenience translations to USD are also provided (unaudited).
* **Consolidation:**  The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of subsidiaries and controlled trusts.  The equity method is used for investments in associates and joint ventures.
* **Revenue Recognition:** A five-step model is followed, using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts where performance obligations are satisfied over time.  Significant judgment is involved in estimating costs to complete, especially for fixed-price contracts.  Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised goods or services to the customers, and this may differ from the timing of invoicing.
* **Financial Instruments:**  Financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value.  Subsequent measurement depends on the classification of the instrument (amortized cost, fair value through other detailed income (FVOCI), or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)).  The Company employs significant judgement and estimation in assessing impairment of financial assets, especially in respect of trade receivables.
* **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** PP&E is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
* **Goodwill and Intangible Assets:** Goodwill is measured at cost less impairment.  Intangible assets (acquired separately or in business combinations) are measured at cost less amortization and impairment.
* **Impairment of Assets:**  Both financial and non-financial assets are assessed for impairment, applying the expected credit loss model for financial assets. The value in use method is used to determine recoverable amounts for long-lived assets and for goodwill in the case of cash generating units.
* **Employee Benefits:**  Defined contribution plans are expensed when the related services are provided.  Defined benefit plans are accounted for using the projected unit credit method.
* **Income Taxes:**  Both current and deferred income taxes are recognized.  The Company carefully assesses the probability of tax positions being sustained during the tax assessments and applies its tax planning strategies in assessing the amount and timing of future tax liabilities and assets.
* **Leases:** The Company adopts IFRS 16 Leases and accordingly recognizes right of use assets and lease liabilities for all leases except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
* **Share-based Payment Transactions:**  Equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognized using the fair value approach.
* **Provisions:**  Provisions are recognized when a present obligation (legal or constructive) exists, an outflow of resources is probable, and the amount can be reliably estimated.  Onerous contracts are also addressed through provisions.
* **Foreign Currency Transactions:**  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates at the date of transaction.  Foreign exchange gains and losses are generally recognized in the statement of income, with some differences deferred to other detailed income for qualifying hedges.


These are some of the key policies;  refer to the detailed notes to the financial statements for a detailed explanation of all accounting policies used by Wipro.  The complete annual report should be consulted for full clarity.
