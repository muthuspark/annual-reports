#### Jupiter Wagons Limited - Financial Risk Analysis Report

*   **Date of Report:** August 19, 2024
*   **Based on Annual Report for F.Y. 2023-24**

#### Risk Profile Summary:

Jupiter Wagons Limited (JWL) operates in sectors intrinsically linked to economic cycles, government policy, and capital expenditure, leading to a multifaceted risk environment. Key risks revolve around customer concentration, raw material volatility, operational execution, and successful diversification. The company has a substantial order book (₹7,102 Cr as of March 31, 2024), providing revenue visibility but also concentrating risk if execution falters or key orders are impacted. Recent acquisitions (Stone India, Bonatrans India) introduce integration risks but also offer mitigation through backward integration and market expansion. Financial health appears robust, with an upgraded credit rating and successful QIP, but reliance on continued infrastructure spending and managing a diversified portfolio remain critical.

### I. Strategic Risks

#### 1. Dependence on Indian Railways and Government Policy:

*   **Severity:** High. A significant portion of revenue (Wagons: 85.45% of FY24 operational revenue) is linked to Indian Railways and related PSUs.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. While current government focus is strong (National Rail Plan, DFCs), policy shifts or budget reallocations can occur.
*   **Trend:** Stable to Slightly Decreasing. Government initiatives like DFCs and station redevelopment indicate continued investment. However, JWL's diversification efforts aim to reduce this. Wagon revenue as % of total increased from 78.64% in FY23 to 85.45% in FY24, indicating current higher reliance.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Diversification into private sector wagon orders (2,150 units, ₹1,060 Cr in FY24 from private parties).
    *   Expansion into new verticals: eLCVs (Jupiter Electric Mobility), brake systems (JVs with DAKO-CZ, Kovis), containers, Defence (₹473 Cr BOM wagon order), marine, and global markets (MoU with RITES for Zimbabwe, Mozambique tenders).
    *   Acquisition of Stone India (braking systems, engineering) and Bonatrans (wheelsets) to broaden railway offerings and reduce import dependency.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. Diversification is underway, but the core wagon business, heavily reliant on Railways, has grown proportionally faster in FY24.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Adverse policy changes could significantly impact order inflow, revenue, and profitability. A 10-20% reduction in railway orders could translate to a ₹300-₹600 Cr revenue impact based on current wagon revenue.

#### 2. Competition Risk:

*   **Severity:** High. Operates in competitive tenders (public sector) and faces established players and new entrants (private sector, global players).
*   **Likelihood:** High. The industry is inherently competitive.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. As the market grows, more players are attracted. Foreign entrants are a possibility.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Value-added diversification (special-purpose wagons, eLCVs, BESS containers).
    *   Technological alliances (Tatravagonka, DAKO-CZ, Kovis, CAF, etc.) for advanced products.
    *   Backward integration (foundry, wheel plant via Bonatrans) for cost control and supply security.
    *   Focus on quality (ISO, AAR M-1003 certifications) and manufacturing excellence (automation).
    *   Building relationships with a diverse customer base (+40% new clients in FY24).
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderately Effective. JWL is winning orders, but margin pressure can arise from intense competition.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Price wars could erode margins (EBITDA margin FY24: 13.5%, FY23: 12.3%). Loss of market share to competitors.

#### 3. Diversification and New Business Integration Risk:

*   **Severity:** Medium to High. Successful execution of new ventures (eLCVs, drones, BESS, expanded container types, global markets) and integration of acquisitions (Stone India, Bonatrans) is crucial.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. New ventures carry inherent execution and market acceptance risks. Acquisition integration often presents challenges.
*   **Trend:** Increasing, as the company actively pursues diversification and inorganic growth.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strategic JVs and technology partnerships for new product segments.
    *   QIP (₹403 Cr) to fund growth, working capital, and inorganic expansion.
    *   Phased rollout plans (e.g., eLCVs targeting specific metros initially).
    *   Experienced management team overseeing new ventures.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** To Be Determined. Early stages for many new ventures. Successful QIP provides financial backing.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Failure in new segments could lead to write-offs of investment and R&D costs. Integration challenges with acquisitions can delay synergy realization and impact profitability. For instance, the ₹1600 Cr planned investment in Bonatrans over two years needs to yield expected returns.

#### 4. Cyclicality of Commercial Vehicle (CV) Industry:

*   **Severity:** Medium. CV load bodies constitute a portion of revenue (approx. 11.3% in FY24).
*   **Likelihood:** High. The CV industry is inherently cyclical, linked to GDP and industrial activity.
*   **Trend:** Currently Stable, but with potential for downturn. MD&A notes CV sales may decline in FY25 after a strong period.

### Segmental Performance & Outlook

#### Wagons and Rail Components

*   **Performance:** This segment is the dominant revenue contributor, with 91.31% sales growth in FY24. Strong order inflow from Indian Railways and private players.
*   **Outlook (Management Guidance):** Continued strong demand is anticipated, driven by Indian Railways' "Hungry For Cargo" initiative, the National Rail Plan (targeting 45% freight market share by FY30), and significant investments in Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs). Completion of EDFC and WDFC, with proposals for three new DFCs (₹2 trillion investment), should drive wagon demand. Management expects growth aligned with the rail freight sector's upward trajectory.
*   **Assumptions:** Sustained government focus on railway infrastructure, achievement of DFC operational targets, and continued private sector participation.

#### Load Body & Components for Commercial Vehicles (CVs)

*   **Performance:** Sales grew by 31.10% in FY24.
*   **Outlook (Management Guidance):** The CV industry is transforming (alternative fuels, electrification). While long-term demand is positive (8% CAGR projected for CV market till 2028), FY25 volumes are expected to plateau. Management anticipates a 10-12% upward trend in the application business due to OEM focus on fully built solutions and growth in the trailer segment.
*   **Assumptions:** Sustained infrastructure capex, recovery in economic activity post-elections, and successful adaptation to evolving CV technologies.

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

#### Standalone Financial Statements

*   The Statutory Auditors, Walker Chandiok & Co LLP, issued an unmodified opinion, stating that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS.

    *   **Key Audit Matter (KAM):** Revenue Recognition was identified as a KAM due to the multiplicity of products, varied customer specifications, diverse contract terms, and management judgment in determining transaction price including variable consideration.
    *   **Reporting under Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 (Rule 11(g)):** An exception was noted regarding the accounting software (SAP). While the audit trail (edit log) feature at the application level was operational, the feature was not enabled at the database level to log any direct data changes. The auditors stated they did not come across any instance of the audit trail feature being tampered with, other than the consequential impact of this exception.

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

*   The Statutory Auditors, Walker Chandiok & Co LLP, issued an unmodified opinion, stating that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS.

    *   **Emphasis of Matter:** Attention was drawn to Note 53 regarding non-settlement of foreign currency payables by subsidiary Bonatrans India Private Limited (BIPL) aggregating ₹5,811 Lakhs, due for more than six months (some over three years), which is beyond RBI permitted timelines. BIPL has communicated with the AD Bank and RBI for an extension. The opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
    *   **Key Audit Matters (KAMs):**
        1.  **Revenue Recognition:** Same as standalone.
        2.  **Acquisition of Stone India Limited (SIL) and Bonatrans India Private Limited (BIPL):** Accounting for these acquisitions was a KAM due to the materiality of amounts, management judgment in determining the acquisition date, identifying assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and their fair valuation (especially for BIPL which involved intangible assets and goodwill).
    *   **Other Matter:** The audit relied on reports of other auditors for one subsidiary and four joint ventures (financials audited by others) and on management-certified financial information for parts of two newly acquired subsidiaries (SIL and BIPL for the post-acquisition period, deemed not material). Unaudited financial statements of one subsidiary (Habitation Realestate LLP, deemed not material) were also considered.
    *   **Reporting under Rule 11(g):** Same exception regarding the audit trail feature in SAP at the database level was noted for the Group.

#### Internal Financial Controls (Standalone & Consolidated)

*   An unmodified opinion was issued on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements as of March 31, 2024.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

#### Basis of Preparation

*   Financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), on an accrual basis under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments and plan assets measured at fair value.

#### Key Policies

*   **Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):** Recognized at a point in time when control of goods is transferred. Involves a 5-step process. Transaction price considers fixed and variable consideration (e.g., price adjustments for raw materials).
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average for raw materials; manufacturing cost for finished goods/WIP) and net realizable value.
*   **Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over useful lives specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Goodwill:** Arising on amalgamation/acquisition, tested for impairment annually or when indicators exist. Not amortized.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Software is amortized over 3-5 years; customer relationships (from BIPL acquisition) over 10 years.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized. Short-term and low-value leases are expensed on a straight-line basis.
*   **Financial Instruments (Ind AS 109):** Measured initially at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends on classification (amortized cost, FVTPL, FVOCI). Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model applied for impairment.
*   **Foreign Currency Transactions:** Recorded at exchange rates on transaction dates. Monetary assets/liabilities restated at year-end rates.

#### Changes in Accounting Policies

*   No new standards or amendments issued by MCA were applicable to the company for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, that necessitated a change in accounting policies. Policies appear consistent year-on-year.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

#### Management's Assessment

*   The Board's Report and MD&A state that the company has a comprehensive internal control mechanism, and management has tested its effectiveness. Internal audits are conducted by a leading auditing firm and reviewed by the Audit Committee.

#### Auditor's Opinion

*   The Statutory Auditors, in their Annexure B to both Standalone and Consolidated Audit Reports, issued an unmodified opinion, stating that the company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such controls were operating effectively as of March 31, 2024.

#### Specific Weakness (Audit Trail)

*   The auditors' report on compliance with Rule 11(g) regarding the audit trail feature in SAP (not enabled at the database level for direct data changes) indicates a specific internal control deficiency related to IT systems for financial record keeping, even though the application-level audit trail was functional.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

#### Overall Compliance

*   The Secretarial Audit Report (Annexure E to Board's Report) states that the company has complied with the provisions of the Companies Act 2013, SCRA 1956, Depositories Act 1996, FEMA 1999 (to extent applicable), and various SEBI Regulations. No qualifications were made.
