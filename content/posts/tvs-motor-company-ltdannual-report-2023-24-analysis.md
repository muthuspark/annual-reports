Strategic focus remains on premiumization, EV leadership, international market expansion, and sustainability.

*   **Domestic Market:** Domestic Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) two-wheeler sales increased by 19%, outpacing the industry growth of 13%.

*   **International Business:** Total exports experienced a slight decline, with two-wheeler exports at 0.89 million units (down 3% YoY) and three-wheeler exports at 0.13 million units (down 18% YoY).

### Market Environment & Outlook

*   **India:** Expected continued GDP growth (~6.5%+), stable urban consumption, potential rural recovery (monsoon dependent), and government infrastructure spending are positive indicators for the domestic two-wheeler market. Premiumization and urbanization trends support demand. EV adoption continues, influenced by TCO and government policies (EMPS replacing FAME II).
*   **Global:** Geopolitical strife and shipping disruptions remain concerns impacting international markets, particularly Africa. However, moderating inflation and stabilizing currencies are expected to aid recovery in export markets in FY25. The global shift towards EVs presents opportunities.
*   **TVSM Outlook:** The company expresses a positive outlook, anticipating continued outperformance in the domestic market and a recovery in international business. Focus on premiumization, EV expansion (both domestic and international), and operational efficiency remain key drivers. The product pipeline for FY25-26 includes further premium offerings.

### Risk Analysis

*   **Geopolitical & Economic:** Ongoing global conflicts, shipping disruptions (Red Sea), inflation, and currency volatility in export markets pose risks to international business performance and costs.
*   **Supply Chain:** While improving, potential disruptions, particularly for EV components, remain a concern.
*   **Demand-Side:** Sluggish rural recovery, potential impact of monsoon variability on agricultural output, regulatory changes affecting retail finance availability, and vehicle price affordability impacting lower segments.
*   **Regulatory:** Changes in EV subsidies (FAME II to EMPS), evolving emission norms (E20, Flex Fuel readiness), and regulations in export markets require adaptability.
*   **Competition:** Intense competition in both ICE and rapidly evolving EV segments necessitates continuous innovation and market responsiveness.

### ESG Integration

TVSM emphasizes ESG integration into its strategy. Key achievements include meeting 93% of energy requirements via renewable sources, 100% co-processing for hazardous waste, significant reduction in water consumption, and biodiversity conservation efforts. CSR initiatives through Srinivasan Services Trust (SST) continue to focus on rural development, impacting 1.6 million beneficiaries. The company aims for Net Zero carbon emissions.
