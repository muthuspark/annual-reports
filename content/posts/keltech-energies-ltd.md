## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis examines Keltech Energies Limited's (KEL) 2023-24 annual report, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

KEL reported a significant improvement in profitability during FY2023-24 compared to the previous year.

* **Net Profit:** Rs. 1,849.14 Lakhs (FY2023-24) vs. Rs. 1,104.73 Lakhs (FY2022-23), a substantial increase of 67%.
* **Operating Profit:** Rs. 3,516.53 Lakhs (FY2023-24) vs. Rs. 2,611.66 Lakhs (FY2022-23), a 35% increase.
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** INR 194.13 (FY2023-24) vs. INR 119.21 (FY2022-23), a 63% rise.
* **Revenue:** Rs. 45,428.04 Lakhs (FY2023-24) vs. Rs. 56,530.02 Lakhs (FY2022-23), a decrease of 20%.  This revenue decrease despite higher profitability suggests improved operational efficiency and cost control.

**Key Financial Ratios (Significant Changes Highlighted):**

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 21% (FY2023-24) vs. 16% (FY2022-23) - A +34% increase, indicating improved profitability relative to shareholder investment.
* **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** 8.65 (FY2023-24) vs. 12.01 (FY2022-23) - A -28% decrease, potentially indicating slower inventory movement or a strategic shift in inventory management.
* **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:** 8.17 (FY2023-24) vs. 10.41 (FY2022-23) - A -22% decrease, suggesting potentially slower collection of receivables.
* **Net Capital Turnover Ratio:** 14.90 (FY2023-24) vs. 29.74 (FY2022-23) - A -50% decrease, indicating a significant reduction in sales efficiency relative to capital employed.
* **Net Profit Ratio:** 4.32% (FY2023-24) vs. 2.12% (FY2022-23) - A +104% increase, showing a substantial improvement in profit margins.
* **Debt Service Coverage Ratio:** 2.84 (FY2023-24) vs. 2.30 (FY2022-23) - A +24% increase, implying improved ability to service debt.
* **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** 25.12% (FY2023-24) vs. 19.90% (FY2022-23) - A +26% increase, showing better returns on capital invested.


**II. Business Segments:**

KEL operates in two main segments:

* **Explosives Division:**  Experienced a slight decrease in explosives sales (59,736 MT vs. 61,603 MT) due to unviable prices in the coal sector. However, traded goods, services, and exports in this sector showed growth. Detonator fuse sales remained relatively stable, while other accessories sales increased significantly due to expanded customer base and export orders.
* **Perlite Division:** Sales of perlite and perlite-based products increased by 12% (18,039 MT vs. 16,123 MT), driven by growth in filter-aid markets.  The report highlights diversification efforts into new markets and the development of crop-specific products for the tissue culture industry.

**III. Risks and Concerns:**

The report acknowledges many key risks:

* **Shortage of Skilled Labor:** A common challenge in many industries, this could impact production and expansion plans.
* **Competition:**  Competition in both domestic and international markets poses a threat to market share and pricing power.
* **Stringent Government Regulations:**  The explosives industry is heavily regulated, requiring compliance with safety and licensing requirements.  Non-compliance could lead to penalties and operational disruptions.
* **Manufacturing Risks:**  The report mentions risks at various manufacturing locations, suggesting the need for continuous improvement in operational safety and efficiency.
* **Market Risks:**  The company actively seeks expert advice to identify and mitigate market-related risks.


**IV. ESG Initiatives (Corporate Social Responsibility - CSR):**

KEL's CSR activities focus on education, healthcare, and rural development.  While the report details specific projects and expenditures (Rs. 20.15 Lakhs spent, exceeding the mandated 2% of average net profit), a detailed ESG framework beyond CSR is lacking in the report.  There's no mention of environmental impact assessments or specific targets, social inclusion beyond the CSR activities, or detailed governance practices beyond board composition and committee structures.  The provided information is limited and lacks quantifiable metrics for detailed ESG analysis.


**V. Overall Assessment:**

KEL demonstrated strong financial performance in FY2023-24, showing significant profit growth despite a revenue decline.  This highlights efficient cost management and operational improvements. However, the revenue decrease and some key ratio changes (inventory turnover, trade receivables turnover, net capital turnover) warrant further investigation into operational efficiency and sales strategies.  The company acknowledges significant risks, especially in relation to regulations and competition.  The CSR initiatives are positive, but a more robust and transparent ESG reporting framework is needed to fully assess the Company's sustainability performance and long-term prospects.  The report's limited disclosures on various compliance matters with stock exchange regulations, resulting in penalties, also raises some concerns regarding corporate governance.  Further detail on the nature of those violations would be beneficial for a complete evaluation.

* **Net Income:** Rs. 1,941.28 Lakhs
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** Rs. 4,192.62 Lakhs (calculated as Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization).  Note that the report does not explicitly state EBITDA.
* **Basic EPS:** INR 194.13
* **Diluted EPS:** INR 194.13

**Important Note:**  All monetary values are in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 INR).  Multiply by 100,000 to get the amounts in Rupees.  The EBITDA figure is a calculation based on the provided financial statements and may vary slightly depending on the specific items included in the calculation.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on Keltech Energies Limited's 2023-24 statement of cash flows:

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** Rs. 5,120.34 Lakhs
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** Rs. -1,676.43 Lakhs (negative indicates a net cash outflow)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** Rs. -1,131.36 Lakhs (negative indicates a net cash outflow)

**Important Note:**  These figures are in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 INR). Multiply each by 100,000 to get the amounts in Rupees.

### Cash Flow Metrics
Based on Keltech Energies Limited's 2023-24 annual report, we can calculate the following:

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This requires a calculation not explicitly provided in the report.  A common calculation is:  Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures.  Using the figures from the statement of cash flows:

    FCF = Rs. 5,120.34 Lakhs - Rs. 913.49 Lakhs (Capital Expenditure from Investing activities) - Rs. 12.15 Lakhs (Capital Expenditure from Intangibles) = Rs. 4,204.70 Lakhs

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** Rs. 925.64 Lakhs (This is the sum of capital expenditures reported in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows: Rs. 913.49 Lakhs for Property, Plant, and Equipment and Rs. 12.15 Lakhs for intangible assets.)

* **Dividends Paid:** Rs. 15.00 Lakhs

**Important Note:** All figures are in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 INR). Multiply by 100,000 to convert to Rupees.  The free cash flow calculation is an approximation; other methods for calculating FCF might exist and lead to slightly different results.  The provided figures in the report only show expenditure.  In the statement of changes in equity, they show that 15 lakhs were paid in dividends.

### Profitability Ratios
To calculate the profitability ratios for Keltech Energies Limited for the fiscal year 2023-24, we'll use the figures previously extracted from the annual report.  Remember that all figures are in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 INR).

* **Gross Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100 = (2,110.82 Lakhs / 44,934.36 Lakhs) * 100 = 4.7%

* **Operating Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (2,604.50 Lakhs / 44,934.36 Lakhs) * 100 = 5.8%

* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (1,941.28 Lakhs / 44,934.36 Lakhs) * 100 = 4.3%

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100.  To calculate the average shareholders' equity, we need the beginning and ending balances.  The ending balance is 9,956.29 Lakhs. Unfortunately, the beginning balance is not directly stated in the report and would require further calculations.  Therefore, a precise ROE cannot be reliably calculated from the information provided.

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100.  Similar to ROE, calculating the average total assets requires information not readily available.  Therefore, a precise ROA cannot be calculated.

**Important Note:** These calculations are approximations due to rounding in the original financial statements.  The ROE and ROA calculations require further data from the report (beginning balances for shareholders' equity and total assets) to be calculated accurately.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate the liquidity ratios for Keltech Energies Limited for the fiscal year 2023-24, we use the values previously extracted from the annual report. Remember that all figures are in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 INR).

* **Current Ratio:** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) = (14,495.06 Lakhs / 10,978.64 Lakhs) = 1.32

* **Quick Ratio:** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities = (14,495.06 Lakhs - 3,453.49 Lakhs) / 10,978.64 Lakhs = 1.01

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities) = (2,991.60 Lakhs / 10,978.64 Lakhs) = 0.27

**Important Note:** These are approximations due to rounding in the original financial statements.  A truly precise calculation would involve using unrounded numbers.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating Keltech Energies Limited's efficiency ratios for FY2023-24 requires careful consideration of the information provided in the annual report.  Remember that all monetary figures are in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 INR).  We'll also need to make some assumptions, and there is the potential for slight inaccuracies because of rounding in the original financial statements.

* **Asset Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Total Assets).  To calculate this accurately, we need the total assets at the beginning of the fiscal year, which isn't explicitly stated.  An approximation can be made by using the year-end total assets, but this would be less accurate.

* **Inventory Turnover:** (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory).  The Cost of Goods Sold isn't directly given, but it can be approximated.  The annual report lists Cost of Materials Consumed as 30,408.84 Lakhs and Purchases of Stock-in-Trade as 1,878.97 Lakhs, giving a rough approximation of COGS as  32,287.81 Lakhs (30,408.84 + 1,878.97). The average inventory requires both beginning and ending inventory values. Only the year-end value is given (3,453.49 Lakhs). Using the year-end value as a proxy for the average would be a simplification.

* **Receivables Turnover:** (Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable).  This calculation requires both beginning and ending values for accounts receivable, which are not provided directly. Using only the year-end value of 4,815.61 Lakhs as an approximation for the average will result in a simplified and potentially less accurate measure.


**In summary:**  While we can approximate these ratios using the available data, they will be less precise than if we had the beginning-of-year balances for total assets, inventory, and accounts receivable.  To obtain more accurate calculations, you would need to obtain these values directly from the company or through financial databases.

### Leverage Ratios
Let's calculate the use ratios for Keltech Energies Limited for FY2023-24 using the figures previously extracted from the annual report.  Remember that all monetary figures are in Lakhs (1 Lakh = 100,000 INR).  There's potential for minor inaccuracies due to rounding.

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity = 2,402.26 Lakhs / 9,956.29 Lakhs = 0.24 or 24%

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets = 2,402.26 Lakhs / 22,267.62 Lakhs = 0.11 or 11%

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  EBIT isn't directly provided, so we'll calculate it: EBIT = Profit Before Tax + Interest Expense = 2,604.50 Lakhs + 235.94 Lakhs = 2,840.44 Lakhs.  Therefore: Interest Coverage Ratio = 2,840.44 Lakhs / 235.94 Lakhs = 12.04


**Important Note:** These are approximations due to rounding in the financial statements.  A precise calculation would use the unrounded figures.  Also, the interest expense used is from the statement of profit and loss, which includes lease interest.  A more refined analysis might separate this interest from other interest costs, especially if using a stricter definition of debt (excluding lease liabilities).



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
Calculating these market-based ratios for Keltech Energies Limited requires information not included in the provided annual report.  The annual report contains only the company's financial statements; market data (share price, number of outstanding shares) is needed to compute these ratios.

* **Market Capitalization (Market Cap):** This is calculated as the current market price per share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares.  The annual report does not provide the current market price.

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio):** This is calculated as the market price per share divided by the earnings per share (EPS).  We need the market price per share to calculate this.

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (PB Ratio):** This is calculated as the market price per share divided by the book value per share.  The book value per share can be derived from the balance sheet (shareholders' equity/number of shares), but we still need the market price per share.

* **Dividend Yield:** This is calculated as the annual dividend per share divided by the market price per share, expressed as a percentage. We need both the dividend per share (which can be obtained from the report) and the market price per share.

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** (Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100.  Using the figures from the annual report: (15 Lakhs / 1,941.28 Lakhs) * 100 = 0.77%


In short, the annual report does not provide the necessary market data (share price) to calculate market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, and dividend yield.  Only the dividend payout ratio can be reliably calculated from the given data.  This calculation is an approximation due to rounding in the original statement.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
Keltech Energies Limited's annual report provides limited segment information, making a complete analysis challenging.  The report identifies two operating segments but lacks detail in many areas.  Here's what can be gleaned:

    * **Growth Rate:**  The report states a 12% increase in perlite and perlite-based product sales. This is a growth rate for sales volume, not necessarily revenue.
    * **Operating Margin:** Not directly stated for this segment.
    * **Market Share:**  Not disclosed in the annual report.
    * **Key Products:** Cryogenic insulation, Industrial filter-aid, Horticulture products.
    * **Geographic Presence:** India (primarily), with possible exports.  Specific regions are not disclosed in the report.

**Limitations:**

The annual report doesn't provide a detailed segment breakdown of revenue, operating margins, or market share.  This limits the accuracy of a detailed analysis.  Furthermore, the geographic presence for both segments is only generally described as "primarily India" with some exports; more detailed information is required for a complete picture.





## Risk Management
### Risk Assessment
Keltech Energies Limited's annual report highlights many key risk factors, but it lacks a structured assessment of impact severity, likelihood, and mitigation strategies.  The report mainly lists the risk categories and a description.  We can categorize and describe them, but a thorough risk assessment is not explicitly offered by the company.

### ESG Ratings
The provided annual report for Keltech Energies Limited does *not* include ESG ratings from any external rating agencies.  The report includes a section on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), detailing some social initiatives, but this is not a substitute for a detailed ESG rating from a recognized agency.  To find ESG ratings, you would need to consult specialized ESG data providers like Sustainalytics, MSCI ESG Ratings, Refinitiv, Bloomberg, etc., or search their databases using the company's name.

### ESG Initiatives
Keltech Energies Limited's annual report provides limited information on environmental and sustainability goals.  The report focuses primarily on the company's financial performance and corporate governance. While there's a CSR section, it doesn't offer detailed details on broader ESG matters.

**I. Environmental Initiatives:**

The report lacks specific details on environmental initiatives.  The explosives and perlite industries have inherent environmental impacts, and the absence of specific environmental initiatives or targets in the report is a significant gap.  There is no mention of a carbon footprint.  Further information would be necessary to assess environmental performance.

**II. Carbon Footprint:**

The annual report does *not* disclose Keltech Energies Limited's carbon footprint.  This is a critical omission for a company operating in industries with substantial environmental impact.

**III. Social Initiatives:**

Social initiatives are primarily addressed through the company's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities.  These focus on:

* **Education:** Providing computers, uniforms, and water dispensers to schools in various locations.
* **Healthcare:** Providing medicines for tuberculosis patients and funding rehabilitation organizations.
* **Rural Development:**  Providing funds to gram panchayats (village councils) and Anganwadi centers (childcare centers).

The report provides specific amounts spent on these initiatives but lacks detailed details about their impact and alignment with broader social sustainability goals.

**IV. Governance Practices:**

The annual report details corporate governance practices, including:

* **Board Composition:**  The board includes a mix of executive, non-executive, and independent directors, with a specified percentage of independent directors.
* **Board Committees:**  The report describes the composition and activities of the Audit Committee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Stakeholders' Relationship Committee, Independent Directors Committee, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee.
* **Code of Conduct:**  A code of conduct is in place for directors and senior management.
* **Performance Evaluation:**  Annual performance evaluations are conducted for the board, its committees, and individual directors.
* **Related Party Transactions:**  The report details transactions with related parties.

While these indicate a structured governance framework, a deeper dive into specific practices and their effectiveness would require further information.

**V. Sustainability Goals:**

The annual report does *not* explicitly state any specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) sustainability goals.  This is a significant omission, especially given the environmental aspects of the company's operations.

**Overall:**

Keltech Energies Limited's annual report provides a limited view of its ESG performance.  While CSR activities demonstrate some social commitment, the lack of transparency regarding environmental initiatives, carbon footprint, and specific sustainability targets is a notable weakness.  More detailed ESG reporting would be beneficial to investors and stakeholders concerned about the environmental and social impact of the company's operations.

### Audit Information
**Auditor's Opinion:**

The independent auditor, CNK & Associates LLP, issued an unmodified (clean) opinion on Keltech Energies Limited's financial statements.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to be fairly presented in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and generally accepted accounting principles in India.  However, the auditor's report also highlighted key audit matters related to the provision for powder factor deduction and litigations.


**Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report outlines many key accounting policies used by Keltech Energies Limited.  These include:

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment:**  Recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.  Depreciation methods vary by asset type.

* **Capital Work in Progress:**  Valued at cost to date.

* **Intangible Assets:**  Recognized when future economic benefits are probable and costs can be reliably measured.  Amortized over their useful lives.

* **Inventories:**  Valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for traded goods.

* **Foreign Currency Transactions:**  Transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the transaction date, and monetary items are translated at the closing rate.

* **Financial Instruments:**  Classified and measured according to Ind AS 109, considering fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through other detailed income (FVOCI), and amortized cost.

* **Revenue Recognition:**  Revenue from sales of goods is recognized upon transfer of control; revenue from services is recognized when services are rendered.

* **Employee Benefits:** Short-term benefits are expensed when services are rendered; defined contribution plans are expensed as contributions are made; defined benefit plans (like gratuity) are accounted for using the projected unit credit method.

* **Impairment of Assets:**  Both financial and non-financial assets are assessed for impairment, using the expected credit loss model for financial assets and value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell for non-financial assets.

* **Provisions:** Recognized when an obligation is present, probable, and reliably estimable.

* **Leases:**  The company adopts Ind AS 116, classifying leases as either finance leases or operating leases.  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for most leases, except short-term and low-value leases.

* **Borrowing Costs:**  Directly attributable borrowing costs are capitalized; others are expensed.

* **Segment Reporting:**  The company reports on two operating segments: Explosives and Perlite.
