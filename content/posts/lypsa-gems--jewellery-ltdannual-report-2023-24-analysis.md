## Financial Analysis of Lypsa Gems & Jewellery Limited (FY 2023-24)

This analysis is based on the 29th Annual Report data for FY 2023-24 and FY 2022-23. A 3-year trend analysis is limited due to data availability. Industry benchmark comparisons are not possible as average data was not provided. All figures are in Lakhs of Rupees unless otherwise stated.

## Executive Summary

Lypsa Gems & Jewellery Limited exhibits significant financial distress, particularly evident in its consolidated performance due to substantial losses from its subsidiary (now under liquidation). Standalone operations also report a net loss. Key concerns include negative profitability, questionable asset quality (high aged receivables), delayed statutory compliances leading to fines, non-transfer of unclaimed dividends, reliance on director loans, and potential working capital strain indicated by high receivables and payables periods. Liquidity ratios appear adequate superficially but are potentially weakened by the quality of current assets. Efficiency metrics indicate poor operational performance.

## Strategic Direction: Lypsa Gems & Jewellery Analysis

### Long-Term Strategic Goals and Progress

Lypsa Gems & Jewellery aims to become a fully integrated diamond company by expanding into retail diamond and jewelry sales to increase profit margins. A key objective is to establish a structured corporate organization with standardized processes and reduce reliance on promoters. Progress includes increasing manufacturing capacity at the Navsari factory and acquiring a facility in Chhapi, Gujarat, for cost-effective production of small-sized diamonds. The strategy prioritizes shifting revenue generation towards manufacturing for higher value-addition and better quality control compared to trading.

### Competitive Advantages and Market Positioning

The company aims to differentiate itself through in-house manufacturing, ensuring consistent production of high-quality standard products and mitigating risks associated with outsourcing. The development of a well-managed corporate structure with standardized processes is also presented as a unique feature compared to typical Indian diamond companies. The focus on producing small-sized diamonds at the Chhapi facility suggests a strategy targeting affordability.

### Innovation Initiatives and R&D Effectiveness

The primary innovation mentioned is the initiative at the Chhapi factory to produce small-sized diamonds at an affordable cost, aiming to expand manufacturing activities.

### M&A Strategy and Execution

The company divested its 100% owned foreign subsidiary, Lypsa Gems & Jewellery DMCC (UAE), with liquidation initiated on March 29, 2024.

### Management's Track Record in Execution

Management has pursued capacity expansion through the Navsari and Chhapi facilities, aligning with the stated strategy to increase manufacturing. The decision to liquidate the unprofitable foreign subsidiary (DMCC) demonstrates execution in portfolio restructuring. However, operational and compliance execution appears challenged, evidenced by:

*   Recurring financial losses (Standalone loss of Rs. 3.11 Lakhs for FY24).
*   Failure to appoint an Internal Auditor as required by Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013.
*   Delays in regulatory filings (SEBI LODR), resulting in fines (Rs. 1.66 Lakhs from BSE, unpaid) and promoter demat account freeze.
*   Non-compliance with depositing unclaimed dividends (Rs. 7.49 Lakhs for FY 2009-10 and subsequent years) into the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) and non-filing of Form IEPF-2, cited due to MCA website issues but remaining non-compliant.
*   Failure to file returns under ESI Act, PTRC Act, and lack of a factory license, indicating gaps in managing statutory compliances.

The proposed re-appointment of the Managing Director and an Executive Director suggests continuity in leadership despite these execution issues.

### Capital Allocation Strategy

The company prioritized conserving financial resources. No dividend was recommended for FY2024 to retain funds for potential business opportunities. No amount was transferred to general reserves. The share capital structure remained unchanged. Funds were previously invested in the foreign subsidiary (Lypsa Gems & Jewellery DMCC), which is now undergoing liquidation. The company reported unsecured short-term borrowings, primarily loans from directors (Rs. 613.58 Lakhs as of March 31, 2024, up from Rs. 600.01 Lakhs).

### Organizational Changes and Their Impact

The Board composition includes an optimum mix of executive, non-executive, and independent directors (4 executive/non-independent, 4 independent), including one woman director, meeting regulatory requirements. Key proposed changes include the re-appointment of Mr. Jeeyan Dipan Patwa as Executive Director (retiring by rotation) and the re-appointment of Mr. Dipan Babulal Patwa as Managing Director for another 5-year term (from August 30, 2024). The liquidation of the subsidiary represents a structural change, simplifying the group structure.

## ESG Analysis

### Environmental Metrics and Targets

*   Disclosures related to conservation of energy and technology absorption under Section 134(3)(m) of the Companies Act, 2013 are not applicable as the company did not carry out manufacturing activities during the reviewed year.
*   The Secretarial Audit Report notes that the company does not possess a factory license, indicating a potential gap in environmental compliance related to operational permits, should manufacturing activities commence or exist.

### Social Responsibility Programs

*   Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Provisions under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 are stated as not applicable, and the company has not developed or implemented any CSR initiatives.
*   Human Resources: The company identifies human resources as an important asset and mentions investment in talent attraction, retention, and development through standard practices like job rotation. As of March 31, 2024, the company had one permanent employee.
*   Workplace Conduct: A policy against sexual harassment aligned with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 is in place. No complaints were received during the financial year 2023-24.
*   Employee Benefits: Standard employee benefits accounting policies are mentioned. However, the Secretarial Audit Report highlights non-filing of required returns under acts like the Employees State Insurance Act 1948 and PTRC (Maharashtra State Tax on Professions, Trades, Callings and Employments Act, 1948), indicating potential non-compliance in social security/statutory employee-related contributions. Management acknowledges this and commits to future compliance.

### Governance Structure and Effectiveness

*   Board Composition: The Board comprises 8 directors (4 Executive/Non-Independent, 4 Independent), including one woman director, complying with the Companies Act, 2013 and Listing Regulations. Director profiles, expertise (Project management, B2B sales, International business, Manufacturing, Talent management), and inter-se relationships are disclosed.

    *   Related Party Transactions: Stated to be on arm's length basis and compliant with regulations, with no materially significant transactions posing potential conflicts. Details are in financial statements.

#### Secretarial Audit Findings & Non-Compliance

The Secretarial Audit Report (MR-3) highlighted several non-compliances for FY 2023-24:

*   Delayed quarterly compliance filings with BSE/NSE (LODR).
*   Non-filing of Form IEPF-2 regarding unclaimed amounts (Sec 125).

## Lypsa Gems & Jewellery Limited - Financial Analysis Report (FY 2023-24)

### Financial Performance Analysis

#### Revenue & Profitability

*   Standalone performance witnessed a dramatic decline in FY24, with Total Income falling to ₹18.08 Lakhs from ₹1,218.96 Lakhs in FY23. The company reported a Standalone Net Loss of ₹3.11 Lakhs compared to a Net Profit of ₹2.75 Lakhs in FY23.
*   Consolidated Total Income decreased to ₹948.86 Lakhs in FY24 from ₹1,218.96 Lakhs in FY23. The Consolidated Net Loss reduced significantly to ₹3,271.17 Lakhs from ₹44,097.22 Lakhs in FY23, primarily due to substantially lower losses reported by the subsidiary under liquidation.

*   No dividend was recommended for FY24, citing the need to conserve financial resources for business opportunities.

#### Balance Sheet Analysis

*   Standalone Equity remained relatively stable at ₹3,180.61 Lakhs. However, Consolidated Equity saw significant erosion, falling to ₹318.31 Lakhs from ₹3,489.48 Lakhs, reflecting the large accumulated losses from the subsidiary.

The ageing schedule reveals a large portion outstanding for over 3 years, with ₹5,229.66 Lakhs classified as doubtful (provided for).

Standalone receivables vastly exceed standalone revenue, suggesting legacy issues or potential inter-company balances not clearly delineated.
*   **Trade Payables (Standalone & Consolidated):** Also remain high at ₹3,682.97 Lakhs, with ₹3,495.96 Lakhs classified as disputed and aged over 3 years, indicating potential financial stress or disputes.

## Financial Analysis Report: Lypsa Gems & Jewellery Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   **Standalone Financial Statements:** The Statutory Auditor (M/s. B. B. Gusani & Associates) issued an *unmodified opinion*, stating the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS. However, under "Report on other legal and regulatory requirements," the auditors noted the failure to transfer significant amounts of unclaimed dividend (FY 2009-10 to 2014-15) and unclaimed fractional shares to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF), as required by law.
*   **Consolidated Financial Statements:** An *unmodified opinion* was issued. The report notes reliance on management certification for the unaudited financial information of the foreign subsidiary (Lypsa Gems & Jewellery DMCC), which is undergoing liquidation proceedings initiated on March 29, 2024. The non-transfer of unclaimed dividends to IEPF by the parent company is also noted.
*   **Secretarial Audit Report:** This report contains *multiple qualifications/adverse remarks*, indicating significant non-compliances:
    *   Non-appointment of an Internal Auditor (Section 138, Companies Act).
    *   Unpaid fine of Rs. 1,66,380 imposed by BSE for late submission (Reg 34, LODR) and consequent freezing of Promoter Demat accounts.
    *   Delayed quarterly compliance filings with Stock Exchanges (SEBI LODR).
    *   Non-filing of Form IEPF-2 for unclaimed dividend details.
    *   Non-deposit of unclaimed dividend amounts (Rs. 7,49,900 for FY 2009-10 and subsequent years) to the IEPF (Section 125, Companies Act).
    *   Non-filing of returns under other statutes (e.g., Employees State Insurance Act, PTRC Act).
    *   Absence of a factory license.
*   **Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2020 (CARO):** Both standalone and consolidated reports reiterate the non-transfer of unclaimed dividend to IEPF and note the absence of an appointed Internal Auditor, although internal financial controls exist. No willful defaulter status reported. No defaults in loan repayments mentioned, but outstanding bank dues noted in standalone Rule 11 reporting.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   **Basis:** Financial statements prepared under historical cost convention, accrual basis, as a going concern, conforming to Indian GAAP / Ind AS. Policies appear consistently applied.
*   **Revenue Recognition:** Sales recognized on transfer of property in goods. Dividend income on right establishment. Interest income on time proportion.
*   **Fixed Assets & Depreciation:** Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the Straight Line Method (SLM) based on useful lives specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value (NRV).
*   **Investments:** Long-term investments at cost less provision for other-than-temporary diminution. The investment in the subsidiary (Lypsa Gems & Jewellery DMCC) is noted as under liquidation application since March 29, 2024.
*   **Foreign Currency Transactions:** Accounted at exchange rates prevailing on transaction dates. Monetary assets/liabilities restated at year-end rates, with differences recognized in P&L.
*   **Taxation:** Current tax based on Income Tax Act provisions. Deferred tax accounted for timing differences, with DTA recognized only upon reasonable certainty of future taxable income.
*   **Changes:** No significant changes in accounting policies were reported for the financial year 2023-24.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   **Over Financial Reporting (Statutory Auditor):** The auditor issued an *unmodified opinion* on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls over financial reporting for both standalone and consolidated entities (excluding the foreign subsidiary for consolidated).
*   **Overall Control Environment (Secretarial Auditor/CARO):** Significant weakness identified due to the non-appointment of an Internal Auditor as mandated by Section 138 of the Companies Act, 2013. This contradicts the Directors' Report claim of having appointed one. This gap raises concerns about the broader internal control framework beyond just financial reporting.
*   **Management Responsibility:** CEO/CFO certified responsibility for establishing, maintaining, and evaluating internal controls.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **Significant Non-Compliance:** Multiple instances documented primarily in the Secretarial Audit Report:
    *   Failure to appoint an Internal Auditor.
    *   Non-payment of BSE penalties and delayed filings under SEBI (LODR).
    *   Violations related to IEPF (non-filing of forms, non-transfer of funds).
    *   Non-compliance with other statutory return filings (ESI, PTRC).
    *   Operating without a factory license.
*   **Management Response:** Explanations provided in the Directors' Report cite liquidity issues, technical difficulties (MCA website), and commitments to rectify non-compliances.
*   **Status:** Several key regulatory requirements under the Companies Act and SEBI (LODR) were not met during the year.

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

*   **Bank Dues:** Auditors noted outstanding dues to Banks as an exception to the general statement of no pending litigations impacting financial position. Details are not provided, but this indicates potential financial stress or default risk.
*   **Regulatory Penalties:** BSE fine imposed and promoter demat accounts frozen represent concrete regulatory actions with financial and operational implications.
