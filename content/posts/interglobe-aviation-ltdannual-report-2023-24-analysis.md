### Market Growth Forecasts

*   India is expected to remain the fastest-growing major economy, with a 6.8% growth estimated for FY 2025.
*   India is projected to become the world's third-largest economy by 2027.
*   The Indian air passenger market, though the third-largest globally, is considered underpenetrated. Domestic seats per capita stood at 0.13, compared to 3.09 in the U.S, international seat per capita is 0.06 compared to the US 0.88 and UK 4.28 in 2023.
*   India's middle-class population is projected to reach 583 million by 2025, increasing disposable income for discretionary spending, including travel.
*   More than 50% of Indian international air travelers are served by foreign airlines; however, the market share for Indian carriers has increased from ~39% in 2018 to ~44% in 2023.

### Planned Strategic Initiatives

*   IndiGo plans to launch a tailor-made business product on the busiest and business routes.
*   IndiGo aims to double its scale by the end of the decade, supported by a large outstanding order book of around 980 aircraft, including longer-range A321XLRs and A350-900 aircraft.
*   Continued focus on domestic market expansion with new destinations.
*   International expansion is a key focus, leveraging the domestic network and partnerships with eight international airlines to serve 49 international destinations.

*   IndiGo plans to add more than one aircraft per week in FY2025.
*   IndiGo is poised to become a 600+ aircraft carrier by 2030.
*   Further investments in technology and infrastructure to support growth.

### Efficiency Improvement Targets

*   Continued efforts to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, with a 19% CO2 reduction per available seat kilometre achieved between FY 2016 and FY 2024.
*   Optimization of fuel-related standard operating procedures (SOPs) such as single-engine taxiing and optimised flight paths.
*   Continued to focus on cost leadership.
*   Ongoing water consumption reduction and waste management initiatives, including the reduction of single-use plastics.

### Potential Challenges and Opportunities

*   **Challenges:**
    *   Supply chain issues impacting spare engine availability for NEO P&W GTF-powered aircraft.
    *   Intense competition in the airline industry.
    *   Fluctuations in fuel prices and adverse movements in foreign exchange rates.
    *   Increased scrutiny and regulatory requirements around environmental sustainability, including potential costs for carbon offsetting and noise abatement measures.
    *   The need to attract and retain highly skilled talent.
*   **Opportunities:**
    *   Underpenetrated Indian aviation market offers significant growth potential.
    *   Growing middle class and increased disposable income in India.
    *   Expansion into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.
    *   The Government of India's commitment to invest ₹1 trillion in airport infrastructure.

### Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity

*   **Fuel Price Sensitivity:** Aircraft fuel expenses represent a significant portion of total costs. Management continuously monitors the fuel prices for implementing fuel-efficient practices.
*   **Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity:** Adverse movements in foreign exchange rates (particularly USD) can significantly impact profitability due to foreign currency-denominated costs (aircraft and engine lease rentals, maintenance, and insurance). The Group is partially hedged from foreign currency deposits. A 1% depreciation/appreciation of the Indian Rupee against the USD would impact profit/loss by Rs. 4,977.98 million.
*   **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** A reasonably possible change of 0.50% in interest rates at the reporting date would have impacted profit/loss by approximately Rs. (299.57) to 299.57 million.
*   **Aircraft Maintenance Obligations Sensitivity:** A 10% difference in the expected cost of maintenance could impact the provision by Rs. 2,253.33 million. A 1% change in the discount rate could impact the provision by Rs 250.87 to (211.82) million.
