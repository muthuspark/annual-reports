### Industry Comparison and Deviations

The report lacks direct peer comparables for a granular, ratio-by-ratio comparison. However, it's stated that BPCL achieved the "Highest GRM among Public Sector Undertakings Oil and Marketing Companies (PSU OMCs)" for FY 2023-24 and the previous year. This suggests a superior refining performance relative to direct PSU competitors. The significant increase in profitability ratios, and the substantial reduction in the debt-equity ratio, is very significant, implying that BPCL performed well above average.

The report does state a market share gain and a higher sales volume, with a market share of 27.57% among PSU OMCs, retaining its position as the second-largest OMC during the year. This signifies BPCL performance.
