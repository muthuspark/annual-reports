## Future Projections and Guidance

### Management Guidance and Assumptions

*   Management's primary objective is to maximize shareholder value.
*   Assumptions are that future taxable profits will be available, the company will continue as a going concern, that company will have access to short and long term funding, and the dealer deposits will secure outstanding receivables.
*   MRF Limited is in line with the Schedule II useful life, but subsidiaries have used different measures.

### Market Growth Forecasts

*   Overall production increased by 9% in the financial year 2023-24, with growth in all product groups except farm tires.

### Planned Strategic Initiatives

*   The company intends to enter into short to medium term purchase contracts, and forward foreign exchange contracts.

### Capital Expenditure Plans

*   Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on Capital Account, net of advances and not provided for, is ₹1334.36 Crores.

### Efficiency Improvement Targets

*   Profits for the year increased due to higher sales, lower raw material costs, and improved efficiencies.

### Potential Challenges and Opportunities

#### Challenges

*   Ongoing litigation with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) regarding an alleged breach of the Competition Act, 2002, with a potential penalty of ₹622.09 Crores.
*   Sensitivity: unhedged exposure to US Dollar is 0.74%, increase or decrease would be +/(-) 0.95 Crores.
*   Exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices (natural rubber, synthetic rubber, compound rubber, and other chemicals).

#### Opportunities

*   Potential for increased profitability due to continued higher sales.
*   Additional Income of 80.33 Crores resulting from the Bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement.

### Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions

## Audit and Regulatory Analysis of MRF Limited

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications
*   The auditors (M.M. Nissim & Co. LLP and Sastri & Shah) issued an unmodified opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements, stating they give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).
*   An emphasis of matter paragraph was included regarding the Competition Commission of India (CCI) penalty, but the opinion was not modified.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes
*   MRF uses historical cost basis except for the following: financial assets and liabilities and defined benefits obligation that has been measured at fair value.
*   Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis, aligned with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, except for Renewable Energy Saving Devices depreciated on a reducing balance basis.
*   Revenue recognition occurs upon the transfer of control of goods to customers, net of variable considerations (discounts, schemes).
*   The Group follows the 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance based on lifetime Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) at each reporting date.

### Internal Control Effectiveness
*   Auditors opined that MRF has adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting, and these controls were operating effectively as of March 31, 2024.
*   The accounting software has an audit trail (edit log) feature, which operated throughout the year, and no tampering was found.

### Regulatory Compliance Status
*   The financial statements comply with Ind AS.
*   Remuneration to directors is within the limits of Section 197 and Schedule V of the Companies Act.
*   No delays were found in transferring amounts to the Investor Education and Protection Fund.
*   Compliance with Section 123 of the Companies Act, 2013 concerning dividends.
*   Compliance with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations.
*   The Company provided full and accurate disclosure about funds advanced or received that might have an end-use of investment or benefiting a third party.
*   There is agreement of current assets returns filed with the bank to the book of accounts.

### Legal Proceedings and Their Potential Impact
*   A significant contingent liability exists related to a penalty imposed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) of ₹622.09 Crores. The matter is under appeal, and the company believes no provision is necessary.
*   Other disputed demands exist for Sales Tax, Excise/Customs Duty, Income Tax, and Goods and Service Tax, with amounts deposited against these demands.

### Related Party Transactions
*   Transactions occurred with subsidiary companies (MRF Corp Ltd, MRF International Ltd, MRF Lanka (Private) Ltd., MRF SG PTE. LTD), Key Management Personnel (KMP), close family members of KMP, and entities where directors are interested.
*   Transactions included sales, purchases, services, selling and distribution expenses, dividends, and professional charges.
*   Outstanding balances at year-end were unsecured and interest-free.

### Subsequent Events
*   A final dividend of ₹194 per share, amounting to ₹82.28 Crores, was proposed for FY 2023-24, to be recognized in FY 2024-25 upon shareholder approval.

### Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment
*   **Accounting Quality:** The use of an unmodified audit opinion and adherence to Ind AS indicates sound accounting quality. Consistent application of accounting policies further supports this. However, the use of judgment in areas like useful lives of assets, impairment, and provisions introduces a degree of subjectivity.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The most material element is a penalty imposed by the Competition Commission of India. Other than that risk appears at a generally acceptable level with compliance confirmed and the only outstanding issue being normal disputed demands.
