### Guidance

The company is on track with its revised guidance, achieving 75% of the INR 980 Cr revenue target and 77% of the INR 295 Cr PAT target in the first 9 months.

### Growth Areas

Strong growth was driven by AUM increase and robust net flows, particularly in Equity Mutual Funds (net flows up 51% YoY for 9M). Trail revenue showed significant growth, indicating a strong recurring revenue base.

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

### Shareholder Rewards

Announced a 1:1 bonus share issuance.

### Core Business Focus

Continued emphasis on the flagship Private Wealth business (Mutual Funds & Structured Products), Digital Wealth (B2B2C), and OFA (SaaS platform for advisors). Management stressed the strategy of *not* launching new products frequently.

### Operational Updates

*   Increased client onboarding threshold to INR 1 crore minimum for new clients.
*   Added 1,515 net new client families in 9M FY25 (Total: 11,426).
*   Added 61 net new Relationship Managers (RMs) in the last 12 months (Total: 383).
*   Maintained near-zero *regret* RM attrition (1 RM loss >INR 40 Cr AUM in the last 6 quarters).
*   Achieved very low client attrition (0.28% of AUM lost in 9M FY25).

### International Expansion

Plans approved to set up a subsidiary in the UK to explore wealth management opportunities. Gift City potential is being explored cautiously.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

Acknowledged the industry trend towards passive investing but stated Anand Rathi Wealth will stick to active management as long as it benefits clients. Addressed the high interest rate environment, suggesting neutrality/potential benefit for their structured products due to derivative pricing mechanics.

### Competitive Positioning

Management differentiated the firm based on:

*   **Consistency & Market Agnosticism:** Ability to deliver growth regardless of market conditions.
*   **Low Attrition:** Near-zero RM regret attrition and low client attrition seen as unique strengths.
*   **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** Belief that their model portfolio (beta ~0.6-0.65) performs well, especially in volatile markets.
*   **Valuation Metrics:** Highlighted high ROE and low PEG ratio relative to peers.
*   **Focus:** Portfolio approach rather than product pushing; resistance to trends like NFOs or unlisted stocks.

### Market Share

Aspiration to increase market share in MF Category 3 AUM from ~1.37% currently to 4% over the long term. Current net flow market share (~4.8% ex-SIP) is higher, indicating progress towards this goal.

### Competition

Dismissed concerns about competition from discount brokers entering the AMC space, suggesting Anand Rathi's value proposition (advice, mathematics-based approach) will sustain its business.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Valuation

Acknowledged analyst questions regarding high valuation multiples compared to peers, responding by emphasizing unique business strengths (consistency, low attrition, ROE/PEG).

### Attrition (Aspiration vs. Reality)

While currently very low, management acknowledged client attrition is ideally zero and RM retention requires cultural fit.

### Operating Leverage

While visible, management tempered expectations for significant margin expansion, stating excess leverage would be reinvested for growth.

### Market Conditions

While claiming market agnosticism, significant market downturns could still impact AUM values and potentially client sentiment, though the model is designed to mitigate this.

### Regulatory Landscape

Mentioned MF trail regulations (no recent changes impacting them) and SEBI's short-selling limits (viewed positively). Future regulatory changes remain an external factor.
