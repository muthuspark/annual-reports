## Risk Profile Analysis: Fusion Finance Limited

### 1. Strategic Risks

*   **Risk Description:** Risks associated with the company's long-term strategic objectives, including market positioning, competitive landscape, product diversification, geographic expansion, and adaptability to evolving customer needs and technological advancements. The recent name change from "Fusion Micro Finance Limited" to "Fusion Finance Limited" signifies a strategic shift towards a broader range of financial products beyond microfinance.
*   **Severity:** Moderate. Diversification introduces new market and execution risks, while the MFI sector remains competitive.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Execution of diversification and adaptation to market changes is ongoing.
*   **Trend:** Evolving. The company is actively pursuing diversification (MSME loans, exploring new products) and geographic expansion (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana in FY24).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   "Focused & dynamic" approach to adapt to changing environments.
    *   Deep understanding of customer needs in "Bharat," enabling relevant product/service adaptation.
    *   Leveraging technology at customer touchpoints and for new verticals (e.g., in-house MSME platform).
    *   Strategic name change to reflect broader ambitions and attract a wider customer base.
    *   Contiguous geographical expansion strategy.
    *   Focus on customer retention through analytics-led segmentation and loyalty programs ("Humara Fusion").
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Demonstrated adaptability with past growth and recent strategic shifts. Successful launch and growth of MSME vertical (AUM ₹538 Cr in FY24, up from ₹333 Cr in FY23). Planned MSME platform launch indicates proactive tech integration.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Successful diversification can lead to increased AUM, revenue streams, and market share. Failure in new ventures or inability to adapt could lead to market share loss, slower growth, or write-offs on new investments. Rebranding associated with name change incurs costs. Expansion into new geographies entails setup and operational costs.

### 2. Operational Risks

*   **Risk Description:** Risks of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. This includes IT system failures, cybersecurity threats, fraud, human error, business continuity disruptions, and employee-related risks.
*   **Severity:** Moderate to High. Dependency on IT infrastructure and a large field force (13,807 employees) makes these areas critical.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Ongoing vigilance required for IT security and managing a distributed workforce.
*   **Trend:** Stable, with increasing focus on IT & Digital. Employee engagement initiatives are active.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **IT & Cybersecurity:** "Zero Tolerance" policy. End-to-end encryption, Wildfire by Prisma Access, dual network connections, AWS hosting, Palo Alto Prisma Access SIG for traffic prioritization, disaster recovery drills, in-house and external expert solutions.
    *   **Human Resources:** Comprehensive employee engagement ("Connect, Cultivate, Celebrate"), strong induction, L&D ("Fusion Gurukul" with >12,500 employees trained in FY24), grievance redressal (2968 queries resolved with 1.2-day TAT in FY24), performance management, R&R.
    *   **Process & Internal Controls:** Documented policies, internal audit function, whistleblower policy (no references in FY24), geo-tagging for client validation, PAR-based disbursement halts, RPA for credit appraisal. Statutory auditors noted adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, except for a comment on audit trail features in certain third-party software (loan and payroll records) where SOC 1 Type 2 reports did not fully cover audit trail requirements or were absent.
    *   **Fraud:** Reported cash embezzlement cases to RBI (FY24: 40 cases, ₹0.11 Cr; FY23: 12 cases, ₹0.04 Cr). Internal controls and vigilance aim to minimize such occurrences.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** IT infrastructure appears robust with multi-layered security. HR initiatives show high engagement and query resolution. Internal audit function and policies are in place. Auditor's comment on audit trail in specific third-party systems represents an area for improvement. Fraud instances, though small relative to AUM, indicate ongoing branch-level operational risks.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** IT failure/cyber-attack could lead to data loss, operational disruption, and reputational damage. Employee attrition or misconduct can impact productivity and customer relations. Fraud results in direct financial losses (FY24: ₹0.11 Cr, recovery ₹0.05 Cr).

## Fusion Finance Limited - Financial Analysis Report (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The statutory auditors, M/s. Deloitte Haskins & Sells, issued an unmodified opinion on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, stating that they give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).

A modification was noted in the "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" concerning the maintenance of books of account (Section 143(3)(b) of the Act). The auditors reported that while the company used accounting software with an audit trail feature, for accounting software operated by third-party service providers for loan and payroll records, the absence of independent service auditor's System and Organisation Controls (SOC 1) Type 2 reports covering audit trail requirements meant they were unable to comment on whether the audit trail feature was enabled and operated throughout the year for all relevant transactions, or if it was tampered with. This is also detailed in Note 59 to the financial statements.

### Key Accounting Policies

Fusion Finance Limited prepares its financial statements in accordance with Ind AS. Key accounting policies include:

*   **Revenue Recognition:** Interest income is recognized using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Fee and commission income from facilitation and business correspondence services are recognized upon completion of performance obligations.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Financial assets are classified based on the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics (SPPI test) and measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), or Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI). The company primarily holds loans at amortized cost.
*   **Impairment of Financial Assets (Expected Credit Loss - ECL):** A three-stage approach (Stage 1: 12-month ECL; Stage 2: Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired; Stage 3: Lifetime ECL - credit-impaired) is used. Significant judgment is applied in defining thresholds for 'significant increase in credit risk' (SICR), 'default', grouping of portfolios, estimating recoveries (LGD), and incorporating forward-looking macroeconomic information. This was identified as a Key Audit Matter by the auditors.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding lease liabilities are recognized. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed.
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) and Intangible Assets:** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment. Depreciation is on WDV, and amortization on SLM based on estimated useful lives.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund, etc.) are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (Gratuity) are actuarially valued. Share-based payments are fair valued at grant date and expensed over the vesting period.

No significant changes in accounting policies were reported for FY 2023-24, as per Note 2.23, which states the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) did not notify any new standards or amendments applicable to the company during the year.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

The statutory auditors expressed an unmodified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements (IFCFR) as of March 31, 2024.

The auditors' modification regarding the audit trail for certain third-party loan and payroll software is a specific observation related to the operational aspect of internal controls in those systems, even though the overall opinion on IFCFR effectiveness was unmodified.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **RBI:** The company is a registered NBFC-MFI and states compliance with RBI guidelines, including CRAR (27.53% against required 15% as of March 31, 2024).
*   **SEBI & Stock Exchanges:** The company states compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations, including corporate governance norms.
*   **Companies Act, 2013:** Compliance with provisions related to Board meetings, AGMs, KMP, related party transactions, and secretarial standards is reported.
*   **Specific Issues:**
    *   **Audit Trail:** The auditor's observation on the audit trail for third-party software indicates a specific compliance gap.
*   **Credit Rating:** The company holds investment-grade ratings from CRISIL (A+/Stable), CARE (A+/Stable), and ICRA (A+/Stable).

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

The company does not have any pending litigation that would materially impact its financial position.

### Related Party Transactions

Key related party transactions primarily involve:

*   Remuneration to Key Managerial Personnel (KMPs)
*   Sitting fees and reimbursement of expenses to Non-Executive/Independent Directors.
*   Past transactions with entities like Vivriti Asset Management Private Limited.
