#### Significant Changes in Major Line Items (>10% YoY)

* **Total Assets:** Increased by 52.44%.
*   **Non-Current Liabilities:** Decreased significantly (52.27%), primarily due to a large drop of Borrowings, resulting from loan repayment using proceeds from the QIP.
*   **Current Liabilities:** Increased moderately (9.15%).
*   **Total Liabilities**: Decreased significantly (20.58%).
*   **Other Equity:** Experienced substantial growth(154.14%), primarily due to issuance of share through QIP.

#### Working Capital Trends (Consolidated)

(₹ in million)

| Metric                                  | 31 Dec 2024 | 31 Dec 2023 | Change     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Current Assets                          | 78,619.75   | 42,512.88   | +84.93%   |
| Current Liabilities                     | 45,743.64   | 41,905.86   | +9.15%   |
| **Working Capital (CA - CL)**           | **32,876.11**   | **606.92**  | **+5317%**|

*   **Trend:** VBL's working capital has increased very drastically, shifting from a relatively small positive working capital to a very large positive working capital. This indicates a build-up of current assets (like inventories and cash) and a significant reduction of short-term debt.

#### Asset Quality Metrics (Consolidated)

*   **Inventory Turnover:** (Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory). We need the detailed cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation, etc.) for an accurate calculation. The report provides the data under different line items.
*	**Fixed Asset Turnover:** It is (revenue from operations/Net Block) which gives 1.26 and 1.64 for the current and previous years respectively.
*   **Receivables Turnover:** (Revenue from Operations / Average Trade Receivables). This gives an indication of how quickly VBL collects its receivables.
    *   Calculation: 204,210.63 / ((8,597.74 + 3,732.18)/2) = 33.32 times, for CY2023, the number is 43.22 times. It shows a little slow down.
* **Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):** This is typically not applicable to a beverage company. VBL, does provide for "expected credit loss" on receivables, which is a related concept. The numbers are low relatively.

#### Debt Structure and Maturity Profile (Consolidated)

(₹ in million)

| Debt Type                        | 31 Dec 2024 | 31 Dec 2023 | Maturity                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Non-Current Borrowings           | 8,864.27   | 31,478.86   | > 1 year                |
| Current Borrowings               | 15,561.54  | 20,030.79   | < 1 year                |
| Lease Liabilities (Non-current)  | 3,538.87   | 1,201.81  | > 1 year                |
| Lease Liabilities (Current)      | 1,144.24   | 423.05| < 1 year                |
| **Total Debt**                   | **29,108.92** |**53,134.51**|

*   **Structure:** VBL's debt consists of both long-term (non-current) and short-term (current) borrowings, as well as lease liabilities. A major shift is the substantial reduction in non-current borrowings.
*   **Maturity:** The specific maturity dates are not provided in a consolidated form, but can be found in detail in Note 21E and the cash flow impacts in 21F. The most important takeaway is that a much larger portion of VBL's debt became short-term. This was temporary effect and changed substantially by end of CY2024.

#### Off-Balance Sheet Items (Consolidated)

*   **Contingent Liabilities:** ₹8,917.31 million (31 Dec 2023: ₹5,473.73 million). These are potential obligations that depend on the outcome of future events (e.g., lawsuits, tax disputes). These are significant and growing.
*   **Commitments:** ₹26,343.54 million (31 Dec 2023: ₹30,857.76 million) for capital expenditures. These represent contractual obligations for future spending. These remain very high.
* **Guarantees issued to third party by subsidiaries for business purposes** : 761.71M in CY2023, jumped to 19,076.77 in CY2024.
*   **Operating Leases (as lessor):** The company receives lease income, but the details are not broken out separately in a way that makes calculating a total off-balance sheet amount possible.

#### Key Observations and Potential Discussion Points

*   **Major Shift in Financing:** The massive increase in equity (due to the QIP) and corresponding decrease in debt is the most significant change. This suggests a strategic shift towards a less leveraged capital structure.
*  **Growth and Expansion:** The increase in non-current assets, particularly Property, Plant & Equipment, and Capital Work-in-Progress, coupled with the acquisitions, clearly demonstrates VBL's aggressive growth strategy. The investment in international markets is notable.
*   **Working Capital Increase:** The substantial increase in working capital needs further investigation. Is this due to inventory build-up for new product launches or expansion? Or is it related to less efficient receivables collection?
* **Contingent Liabilities**: A significant increase and needs to be investigated.
