*   The Management, based on internal assessments and external legal opinions, does not expect these demands/claims to succeed and therefore do not consider these to be probable of crystalizing.

*   **Accounting Quality:** The use of estimates and judgments in areas like useful lives of assets, income tax provisions, defined benefit obligations, and contingencies introduces a degree of subjectivity. The unmodified audit opinion suggests that these estimates and judgments are reasonable. The consistent application of accounting policies is a positive indicator.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The Company's biggest regulatory risks appear to stem from the pending indirect tax litigations. While the Company believes these demands are unjustified, adverse outcomes could have a material impact.
