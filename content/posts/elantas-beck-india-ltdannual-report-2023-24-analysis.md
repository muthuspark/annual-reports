## Financial Analysis of ELANTAS Beck India Ltd. - FY2024 Cash Management

### Cash Flow Analysis (FY2024 vs FY2023)

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** ₹6,322.30 (FY24) vs ₹13,341.82 (FY23).
    *   *Key Components (FY24):* Profit Before Tax (₹18,345.03), Adjustments for non-cash items (Depreciation/Amortization: ₹1,690.32; Net gain on FVTPL investments: -₹3,940.37), Changes in Working Capital (Receivables: -₹2,266.44; Inventories: -₹2,119.38; Payables: ₹294.28), Direct Taxes Paid (₹3,989.45). The decrease in OCF is primarily driven by changes in working capital (inventories and receivables) and lower net gains on financial assets compared to FY23.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** ₹7,628.43 (FY24) vs -₹5,481.47 (FY23).
    *   *Key Components (FY24):* Payments for PPE/Intangibles (₹14,514.10, including asset acquisition from Von Roll and land purchase), Net Investment Activity (Purchases: ₹25,970.57; Sales: ₹42,631.77), Net Fixed Deposit Activity (-₹3,570.00 + ₹7,863.00), Interest Received (₹1,188.33). The positive ICF in FY24 is mainly due to significant net proceeds from the sale of investments, offsetting the high capital expenditure.
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** -₹455.19 (FY24) vs -₹396.38 (FY23).
    *   *Key Components (FY24):* Dividends Paid (₹396.38), Interest Paid (₹58.81). FY23 only included Dividend Paid.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation:**
    *   FCF (OCF - Capex) (FY24): ₹6,322.30 - ₹14,514.10 = -₹8,191.80
    *   FCF (OCF - Capex) (FY23): ₹13,341.82 - ₹1,646.41 = ₹11,695.41
    *   *Analysis:* FCF turned significantly negative in FY24 primarily due to the substantial increase in capital expenditures related to land purchase and asset acquisition, coupled with lower OCF.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Ratios (FY24 vs FY23):**
    *   Current Ratio: 6.26 vs 6.11 (+2.29%)
    *   Inventory Turnover Ratio: 5.61 vs 5.50 (+2.00%)
    *   Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio: 6.55 vs 6.65 (-1.50%)
    *   Trade Payables Turnover Ratio: 5.49 vs 5.15 (+6.60%)
*   **Analysis:** The MD&A notes improved Net Working Capital due to focus on inventory and receivables management. The ratios show a stable Current Ratio, slightly improved inventory turnover, slightly slower receivables turnover, and faster payables turnover.
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) Estimation:**
    *   DIO (365/Inventory Turnover): FY24 = 65 days; FY23 = 66 days
    *   DSO (365/Receivables Turnover): FY24 = 56 days; FY23 = 55 days
    *   DPO (365/Payables Turnover): FY24 = 66 days; FY23 = 71 days
    *   CCC (DIO + DSO - DPO): FY24 = 65 + 56 - 66 = 55 days; FY23 = 66 + 55 - 71 = 50 days
    *   *Analysis:* The estimated CCC increased slightly in FY24, indicating a marginally longer period to convert inventory and receivables into cash, primarily driven by faster payments to suppliers (lower DPO).

### Capex Analysis by Segment (FY2024 vs FY2023)

*   **Electrical Insulations:** ₹7,867.26 vs ₹1,448.73
*   **Engineering & Electronic Resins and Materials:** ₹147.58 vs ₹130.46
*   **Other and Unallocable Expenditure:** ₹6,499.26 vs ₹67.22
*   **Total Capex:** ₹14,514.10 vs ₹1,646.41
*   *Analysis:* Total Capex increased substantially in FY24. While segment-specific capex saw a significant rise in Electrical Insulations, the largest portion of the increase falls under 'Other and unallocable', likely reflecting the land purchase (₹5,658 Lakhs) and asset acquisition from Von Roll (₹5,346 Lakhs) mentioned in the Board's Report.

### Dividend and Share Buyback

*   **Dividend:** The Board recommended a final dividend of ₹7.50 per equity share (75%) for FY24, subject to Member approval. This represents a 50% increase from the ₹5.00 per share (50%) paid for FY23. The total payout for FY24 is proposed at ₹594.58 Lakhs.
*   **Share Buyback:** The Company did not undertake any share buyback activities during the financial year 2024.

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Liquidity:** The Current Ratio improved slightly to 6.26 in FY24 from 6.11 in FY23, indicating a very strong short-term liquidity position. Cash and cash equivalents stood at ₹13,962.11 Lakhs, and Other Bank Balances (short-term deposits) were ₹1,546.03 Lakhs as of December 31, 2024. Total Current Assets significantly exceed Total Current Liabilities (₹77,085.42 Lakhs vs ₹12,306.92 Lakhs).
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** As calculated above, the estimated CCC increased from 50 days in FY23 to 55 days in FY24.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield Trends

*   **FCF Calculation:**
    *   FY24: -₹8,191.80 Lakhs
    *   FY23: ₹11,695.41 Lakhs
*   **FCF Yield (FCF / Total Equity):**
    *   FY24: -₹8,191.80 / ₹86,711.94 = -9.45%
    *   FY23: ₹11,695.41 / ₹73,199.41 = +15.98%
*   *Analysis:* FCF yield experienced a significant downturn, moving from a strong positive 15.98% in FY23 to a negative 9.45% in FY24. This reversal is directly attributable to the substantial capital expenditure undertaken during FY24 for expansion and acquisitions, which vastly exceeded the operating cash flow generated during the year. While FY23 showed strong cash generation relative to equity, FY24 reflects a period of significant reinvestment.
