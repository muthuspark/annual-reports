## Financial Analysis Report: Sirca Paints India Limited

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The Independent Auditors, Rajesh Kukreja & Associates, have issued an unqualified opinion on both the Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.

#### Standalone Financials

The auditors state that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024, and its profit, other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year ended on that date.

#### Consolidated Financials

The auditors state that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2024, and their consolidated profit, total comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year ended on that date.

#### Qualifications

No qualifications were noted in either the standalone or consolidated auditor's reports.

#### Key Audit Matters (KAMs)

For both standalone and consolidated audits, the KAMs identified were:

*   Revenue recognition (Note 2.4 & 28): Due to the timing of recognition based on transfer of control and revenue being a key performance measure, there's a risk of revenue being recorded before control is transferred.
*   Discounts and incentives (Note 2.4 & 28): Calculation of these expenses is voluminous, complex, and involves significant judgment, posing a risk of inaccurate recognition.

The auditors detailed procedures undertaken to address these KAMs and found them to be appropriately handled.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

The Company's significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 2 of the Standalone Financial Statements. Key policies include:

#### Basis of Preparation

Financial statements are prepared on an accrual and going concern basis in accordance with Ind AS. The operating cycle is 12 months.

#### Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115)

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods/services to the customer, typically at the point of control transfer (mainly upon delivery). Revenue is measured at fair value of consideration, net of discounts, returns, and GST. Estimates for sales incentives/discounts and returns are based on accumulated experience.

#### Foreign Currency

Transactions are recorded at prevailing exchange rates. Monetary items are retranslated at year-end rates, with exchange differences recognized in profit or loss.

#### Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)

Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a written-down value basis over useful lives prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.

#### Intangible Assets

Carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Useful lives: Design (10 years), Computer software (5 years), Trademarks (5 years).

#### Financial Instruments

Classified and measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL), or Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI). Trade receivables are at amortized cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, net of Expected Credit Losses (ECL). The ECL model is applied using a simplified approach (lifetime ECL) for trade receivables.

#### Employee Benefits

Defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (gratuity) are accounted for using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations at each balance sheet date; remeasurements are recognized in OCI.

#### Inventories

Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value.

#### Leases (Ind AS 116)

Adopted from April 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach (comparatives not restated). Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized.

#### Income Taxes

Current tax is based on taxable profit. Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences.

#### Changes in Accounting Policies

The adoption of Ind AS 116 "Leases" from April 1, 2019, was the significant recent change, applied retrospectively with no impact on retained earnings at the date of initial application. No new significant accounting policy changes were highlighted for the financial year 2023-24.
