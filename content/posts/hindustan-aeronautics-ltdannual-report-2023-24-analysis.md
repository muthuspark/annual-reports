*   **Accounting Quality:** The use of Ind AS and the clean audit opinion indicates a high standard of accounting quality.

While the Company is actively pursuing appointments, the pending fines from stock exchanges pose a financial risk. Furthermore, reliance on government contracts and defense sector policies makes the Company susceptible to changes in government spending and procurement procedures. The Company's compliance with environmental regulations and other laws indicates a low risk in those areas.
