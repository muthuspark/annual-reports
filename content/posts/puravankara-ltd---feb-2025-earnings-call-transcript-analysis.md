### Comparison with Previous Periods

*   Customer collections have grown from ~INR 350 crores per quarter in FY22 to ~INR 1,000 crores per quarter currently.
*   9M FY25 presales (INR 3,724 cr) are comparable to 9M FY24 (INR 3,966 cr). Management attributes the slight dip to launch delays.
*   A significant point highlighted was the accounting difference: "While we have reported a loss of INR99 crores for the 9 months for the financial year under Ind AS, under the percentage of completion method, we would have actually reported profits for this particular period." This was also true for FY23-24 (PBT INR 68 cr under Ind AS vs. INR 160 cr under POC).

### Areas of Growth or Decline

*   **Growth:** Strong YoY growth in Provident sales, customer collections, and average realizations. Operating cash flows for 9M FY25 up 14% YoY to INR 3,209 crores.
*   **Decline/Loss:** Reported net loss for Q3 and 9M FY25 under Ind AS, attributed to upfront expensing of sales/marketing costs for presales and deferred revenue recognition. Debt per square foot increased due to capex and launch deferrals.
