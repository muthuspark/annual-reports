## Audit and Regulatory Analysis: Raymond Limited FY 2023-24

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

#### Standalone Financial Statements

Walker Chandiok & Co. LLP issued an unmodified opinion stating the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view as of March 31, 2024, in conformity with Ind AS.

*   **Reservation:** A reservation was noted under "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" [paragraph 17(h)(vi)] concerning Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014. The audit trail feature was not enabled at the database level for the SAP accounting software, though it was enabled at the application level. The auditors found no evidence of tampering with the audit trail feature, other than the impact of this exception.

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

Walker Chandiok & Co. LLP issued an unmodified opinion on the consolidated financial statements, based on their audit and reports of other auditors for certain subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures.

*   **Reservation:** Similar to the standalone report, a reservation was noted under "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" [paragraph 19(h)(vi)] regarding the audit trail feature. For the Holding Company, its subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures, the audit trail (edit log) facility was not enabled at the database level for SAP. Additionally, one joint venture's accounting software (Denim) did not have an audit trail feature. For one subsidiary using third-party operated software (STAGE), the auditors were unable to comment on the audit trail feature in the absence of an Independent Service Auditor's Assurance Report.

### Key Audit Matters (KAMs)

#### Standalone Financials

*   **Impairment testing of investments in and other recoverable from a joint venture (Raymond UCO Denim Private Limited):** Due to losses suffered by the JV, management performed an impairment assessment using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. This involved significant management estimates. An impairment of ₹2,900 lakhs was recognized in the current year. The materiality and subjectivity involved made this a KAM.
*   **Revenue recognition from real estate project under development:** Revenue of ₹159,090.63 lakhs was recognized over time based on Ind AS 115. This required significant management judgment in determining satisfaction of performance obligations, estimating total contract costs (including contingencies), and the proportion of contract work completed. The materiality and judgment involved made this a KAM.

#### Consolidated Financials

*   **Revenue recognition from real estate project under development:** Same as the standalone KAM, involving significant management judgment in cost estimation and percentage completion for revenue of ₹159,090.63 lakhs.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

#### Basis of Preparation

Financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial assets/liabilities at fair value, assets held for sale, and defined benefit plan assets.

#### Key Policies

*   **Revenue Recognition:** Recognized upon transfer of control. For real estate property development, revenue is recognized over time from the financial year in which the entity's right to payment for performance completed is established, based on the percentage of completion method (input method, i.e., costs incurred to date as a proportion of total estimated costs).
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE):** Stated at cost less depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is generally on SLM for factory buildings/specific non-factory buildings/plant & equipment/aircraft and WDV for other assets, over Schedule II useful lives (except for certain plant & equipment and aircraft based on technical evaluation).
*   **Intangible Assets:** Carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Software is amortized over 3 years (SLM).
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized. Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR) is used for discounting lease payments.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes purchase, conversion, and other costs. FIFO, Weighted Average, or Specific Identification methods are used. Property under development includes land cost, construction costs, overheads, and incidentals.
*   **Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:** Assets are tested for impairment if events indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
*   **Investments in Subsidiaries, JVs, Associates (Standalone):** Carried at cost less impairment.
*   **Financial Instruments:** Classified as amortized cost, FVOCI, or FVTPL based on business model and cash flow characteristics.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Short-term obligations recognized as incurred. Long-term benefits (earned leave, sick leave) measured at present value. Post-employment benefits include defined benefit (gratuity, pension, certain PF) and defined contribution plans. Actuarial valuations are used for defined benefit plans.
*   **Share-Based Payments:** Fair value of options under ESOP 2023 recognized as employee benefits expense over the vesting period.
*   **Foreign Currency Translation:** Transactions recorded at prevailing rates. Monetary assets/liabilities translated at year-end rates.
*   **Income Tax:** Current tax based on taxable income. Deferred tax recognized on temporary differences using the liability method.

#### Changes in Accounting Policies

The accounting policies are stated to have been applied consistently. The impact of recent amendments to Ind AS 8, Ind AS 1, and Ind AS 12 was not material.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

#### Standalone Financial Statements

The Auditor's Report on Internal Financial Controls (Annexure B) expresses an unmodified opinion that the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024.
