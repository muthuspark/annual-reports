### Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The use of Ind AS, consistent application of accounting policies, and an unmodified audit opinion suggest a relatively high degree of accounting quality. The use of estimates and judgments is inherent in financial reporting, but these are subject to audit scrutiny.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The main area of regulatory risk lies in the ongoing tax disputes. The volume of related party transactions warrants monitoring of compliance with Section 188 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 23 of SEBI.
