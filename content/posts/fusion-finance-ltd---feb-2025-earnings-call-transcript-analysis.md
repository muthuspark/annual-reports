The company acknowledged a challenging market but sees long-term benefits from evolving regulations.

### Market Overheating Cooling Off

## Risk Factors & Challenges

Management was transparent about the ongoing challenges.

Admitted to "very high attritions, especially in August, September," which have since "come down to under 50% now" but remain a concern.

Ongoing breaches of financial covenants with some lenders. "As on December '24, we are in breach of financial covenant amounting to INR5,288 crores." Discussions ongoing with remaining lenders.

### Regulatory Uncertainty (Karnataka Ordinance)
