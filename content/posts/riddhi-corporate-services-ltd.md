| Profit After Tax (Rs. Lakhs)      | *Not Directly Stated*| 842.01         | 514.5          | Declining    |
| Earnings Per Share (Basic)         | *Not Directly Stated*          | 7.34           | 4.34           | Declining    |

*Note: 2021-22 data is not fully and directly provided in all relevant sections of the annual report, making precise 3-year trend comparisons difficult for all metrics.*

### 2) Business Segment Performance

The annual report primarily presents consolidated financial results, and does not provide a detailed breakdown of revenue and profitability by individual business segments (Document Management, Contact Centre, Data Entry, Software Development, Verification Services, Recruitment Services, 3PL Logistics).  The report mentions various services offered, but not their individual financial contribution. Thus, a segment-wise performance analysis is not feasible with the presented data.

### 3) Major Strategic Initiatives and Their Progress

The report lacks explicit identification of defined, named strategic initiatives with measurable progress indicators.  However, the following can be inferred:

*   **Expansion into new service areas:**  The report mentions offerings in diverse fields (Document Management, Contact Centre, Data Entry, Software Development, Verification Services, Recruitment, 3PL Logistics), suggesting an initiative to diversify services.  No specific progress metrics are provided.
*   **Technology Adoption:** The report mentions an in-house IT development team and highlights features of their Android-based verification app (real-time tracking, GPS, offline status updates). This points to a strategic focus on technological integration, but quantitative progress is not reported.
* **Client Acquisition and Retention:** A page lists "known clients," implying a focus on acquiring and retaining reputable clients. No metrics related to client growth, churn, or satisfaction are provided.
* **Warrant Issue:** The Company completed the issuance of the Share Warrants for the Preferential Issue. It lapsed after 18 Months.

### 4) Risk Landscape Changes

The Management Discussion and Analysis section provides a general overview of economic and industry risks, but does not delineate specific changes to *Riddhi Corporate Services Limited's* risk profile year-over-year. There is no structured risk assessment framework presenting quantified changes in risk exposure.

### 5) ESG Initiatives and Metrics

*   **Environmental:** The report states the Company's commitment to a clean environment and compliance with statutory requirements, but provides no quantitative environmental metrics (e.g., energy consumption, waste generation, emissions).
*   **Social:** The report includes details of CSR expenditure, meeting the statutory requirement of 2% of average net profit. Actual Amount Spent (Rs. 16.05 Lakhs). The focus area for 2023-24 was "promotion of global well-being" through a donation to the ASHIRVAD FOUNDATION. The company has a Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy, with zero reported cases during the review period. Employee-related data (e.g., diversity, training hours, turnover) is limited.
*   **Governance:** The report provides extensive disclosures on corporate governance practices, board composition, committee structures, and compliance with regulations. There are two reported non-compliances, though:
CSR utilization certificate is yet to be received.
The unspent balance of 2,16,860 on CSR Activites was transferred to the PM CARES Fund 27 days beyond the deadline.
Mr. Bhavin Kiritkumar Pandya and Ms. Kalpanaben Dipakbhai Suthar have not cleared the proficiency test mandated by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs.
There were some other minor compliance issues

### 6) Management Outlook

The Chairman's Letter expresses optimism for the future and emphasizes the company's commitment to customer service, innovation, quality, and commitment. The Directors' Report mentions steps taken for "cost diminution and quality of work" and plans to achieve higher turnover through various marketing strategies.  However, no quantified targets or specific projections are provided. The outlook is generally positive but lacks concrete, measurable goals.

### Comparative Analysis with Industry Averages

The report does not provide sufficient information to benchmark Riddhi Corporate Services Limited's performance against industry averages. Crucial data, such as segment-specific revenue, growth rates, and profitability metrics, is missing. Furthermore, the diversified nature of the company's services makes identifying a single, directly comparable industry benchmark challenging.

*   **Note:** Market Capitalization data is required for Free Cash Flow Yield calculation, but is not present in the provided financials.

### Peer Comparison

Peer comparison requires selecting publicly listed companies in similar business sectors (document management, contact center services, data entry, software development, verification, and recruitment services). Direct, publicly listed peers in India may be limited. A meaningful comparison would require external data on companies like TeamLease Services, Quess Corp, or Firstsource Solutions, if applicable to the specific service mix. This is not possible with the provided data.

### Forward Projections (Based on Historical Trends)

Given only two years of data, projections are highly speculative. However, observations and potential extrapolations (with significant caveats) include:

*   **Revenue:** Revenue declined from FY23 to FY24. Projecting future revenue requires understanding the reasons for this decline (loss of clients, reduced project volume, etc.). A simple trend extrapolation is not advisable without this context.
*   **OCF:** OCF was negative in previous year but improved.
*   **CAPEX:** CAPEX had large increase.
*   **Dividends:** A slight increase in dividends suggests a potential for continued, modest growth in payouts if profitability stabilizes.
*   **Debt:** The low Debt-Equity ratio suggests capacity for further borrowing, which may be needed if CAPEX continues at the FY24 level.
*   Working Capital is a concern based on the numbers presented

**Crucial Caveat:** These are *not* robust projections. They are simple observations based on very limited historical data. True projections would need a detailed business plan, market analysis, and management guidance.

## Industry Comparison and Deviations

Industry  average  data  is  needed  for  a   comprehensive  comparison.  However,  initial observations based on the provided data are:

*   **Profitability:** ROE, ROA, and ROIC, along with the Profit Margins, have declined compared to the previous year, indicating lowered profitability.
*   **Liquidity:** The current and quick ratios are slightly above 1, suggesting a potentially adequate level of liquidity, but not excessive.
*   **Efficiency**: Asset Turnover and Receivables Turnover have decreased. The sharp decline in Receivable turnover ratio, implying a substantial increase in collection period, needs further investigation.
*	**Leverage:** Debt-to-Equity ratio is relatively low, indicating a conservative capital structure. Interest coverage ratio is reasonable, suggesting ability to meet interest obligations.
*	**Working Capital**: The substantial change from a negative to positive figure suggests a significant shift. Increase in receivable days is substantial.



## Business Segments

*    **Earnings Per Share (EPS) (FY23-24)-Basic:**4.34
*    **Earnings Per Share (EPS) (FY23-24)-Diluted:**4.34

**Market Share and Competitive Position (Inferred)**

*   RCSL positions itself as a service provider to Telecom, Banking, NBFC, and IT sectors. Its market share cannot be determined precisely without industry-specific revenue data.
*   The company's competitive position is based on its claimed "skilled manpower, advanced technology, and best-in-class infrastructure".
*   Key clients include Reliance, Vodafone, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, and IDBI Bank. This indicates some level of competitive standing in the Indian market.

**Key Products/Services Performance (Inferred)**

*   **Document Management, Contact Centre, Data Entry, Software Development, Verification Services, and Recruitment Services:** These form the core of RCSL's BPO offerings. No specific performance metrics are provided for each.
*   **3PL Logistics Services:** RCSL highlights its capabilities in warehousing, transportation (65 owned vehicles), and related services. Again, no isolated performance data is available.
*  **ERP,HRMS,Asset Lifecycle Management, Data Entry Systems:**These products cater the IT software development part of the business.

**Geographic Distribution and Market Penetration (Limited Information)**

*   RCSL mentions operations in "9 Circles of India" for various clients. This suggests a focus on the Indian domestic market.
*   The company's registered office is in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
*   Specific market penetration data within these circles is not available.

**Segment-wise CAPEX and ROIC**
