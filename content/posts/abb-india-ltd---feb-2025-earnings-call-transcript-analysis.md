### Comparison

The company highlighted strong growth on top of already robust growth in the previous year (FY23 saw 23% order growth and 22% revenue growth). While Q4 total order intake showed a YoY decline due to base effects, underlying base orders grew. Profitability metrics showed exceptional improvement both YoY and sequentially in Q4.

### Guidance/Forecasts

No explicit numerical guidance was provided for FY25. However, management guided for a PAT margin "corridor of 12 to 15 percentage" going forward, suggesting the record highs of ~15.5-15.8% PAT might moderate slightly as pricing advantages normalize. They expect 65-70% of the current backlog to be executed in CY25.

### Growth/Decline Areas

Strong revenue growth across the board driven by backlog execution. Significant profitability improvement attributed to operational efficiencies, favorable mix (services, premium products), capacity utilization, localization, and past price increases booked when commodity prices were lower. Material costs as a percentage of revenue hit a record low of 58%. Order growth moderated compared to the previous year's high base.
