### Accounting Quality Analysis

*   The accounting quality is supported by the use of Ind AS and consistent application of accounting policies. The unmodified audit opinion reinforces this.
*   Significant estimations are involved in revenue recognition for fixed-price contracts, determination of fair value for certain financial instruments, and employee stock option valuations.
*   The use of the percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition introduces inherent estimation uncertainty.
*   The Company maintains detailed documentation and uses external valuation experts for key estimates, enhancing the reliability of financial reporting.

### Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   The Company is subject to risks associated with changes in tax laws and regulations, particularly in India and the United States, as well as other jurisdictions where it operates.
*   The remark regarding the third-party maintained accounting software represents a minor area where complete assurance on the audit trail feature could not be provided, representing a potential, though not necessarily material, control limitation.
*   The outstanding legal disputes, primarily tax-related, pose a potential regulatory risk, though the Company believes the likelihood of adverse outcomes is low.
