**Important Note:** These numbers are rounded to the nearest Lakh (₹100,000) as reported in the annual report.  Minor discrepancies may arise due to rounding practices.  Also, the categorization of expenses as "operating expenses" might vary slightly depending on the precise accounting classifications used by ITD Cementation.  Always refer to the original report's notes for detailed explanations.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Here's a summary of the Net Income, EBITDA, Basic EPS, and Diluted EPS from ITD Cementation India Limited's annual report, again separated for Standalone and Consolidated figures:

**In Indian Rupees (₹) Lakhs, except for EPS which is in ₹:**

**Standalone Financial Statements (Year Ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Net Income:** ₹27,373.77
* **EBITDA:** ₹79,602.54
* **Basic EPS:** ₹15.93
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹15.93

Minor discrepancies might arise due to rounding.  The Consolidated Net Income is further broken down into the portion attributable to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests.  Always refer to the original annual report for the complete details.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Here's a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows for ITD Cementation India Limited, for the year ended March 31, 2024,  from the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:

**In Indian Rupees (₹) Lakhs:**

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹69,231.53  (This represents the net cash generated from the company's primary business operations after accounting for changes in working capital and tax payments.)

* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(37,853.62) (Negative cash flow indicates net cash outflow. This is primarily driven by capital expenditures on property, plant, and equipment.)

* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹(12,046.91) (Negative cash flow indicates net cash outflow.  This likely includes repayments of borrowings, lease obligations, and dividend payments.)


**Important Note:**  These figures are rounded to the nearest Lakh (₹100,000) as they appear in the annual report.  Minor discrepancies may result from rounding.  The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows would provide a different set of figures, incorporating the cash flows of subsidiaries and joint ventures.  Always consult the original financial statements for complete accuracy.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The annual report doesn't directly provide a single "Free Cash Flow" figure.  Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a calculated metric, typically defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. We can calculate an approximation using the information provided:

**In Indian Rupees (₹) Lakhs:**

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹69,231.53 (from the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows)

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  This isn't explicitly stated as a single number but can be approximated from the investing cash flows. The Standalone Statement of Cash Flows shows net cash used in investing activities of ₹(37,853.62).  This largely represents CAPEX, although it also includes proceeds from disposals and other investing activities.  Therefore, we'll use this as a *proxy* for CAPEX for a simplified FCF calculation.  A more precise figure would require a detailed review of the investing activities notes.

* **Approximated Free Cash Flow (FCF):** ₹31,377.91 (Operating Cash Flow -  Proxy CAPEX: ₹69,231.53 - ₹(-37,853.62))

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹12,86.07 (from the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows).  This is the amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year 2023-24 for the shareholders.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Consolidated vs. Standalone:** The above calculations use data from the *Standalone* Statement of Cash Flows.  The Consolidated Statement would give different figures, reflecting the cash flows of subsidiaries and joint ventures.

* **Approximation of CAPEX:**  The negative investing cash flow is used as a *proxy* for CAPEX.  Other investing activities (such as proceeds from asset sales) are included in this number and would need to be removed for a more accurate CAPEX figure.  Therefore, the FCF calculation above is an approximation.

* **Other Uses of Cash:**  Free cash flow calculations often consider other cash outflows, such as debt repayments (already included in financing activities), which are not separately detailed in the provided excerpt.  A complete FCF calculation would include all such items.


To obtain a more precise FCF and CAPEX, it is necessary to carefully examine the notes to the financial statements within the full annual report.



## Financial Ratios
### Profitability Ratios
Let's calculate the profitability ratios for ITD Cementation India Limited using the figures from both the Standalone and Consolidated financial statements.  Remember these are based on the numbers provided and rounding may cause slight variations.

**In percentage (%)**

**Standalone Financial Statements (Year Ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Gross Margin:** 35.9%  (₹270,889.64 Gross Profit / ₹754,211.45 Revenue)
* **Operating Margin:** 2.7% (₹20,371.82 Operating Income / ₹754,211.45 Revenue)
* **Net Profit Margin:** 3.6% (₹27,373.77 Net Profit / ₹754,211.45 Revenue)
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 20.0% (₹27,373.77 Net Profit / [(₹123,753.18 + ₹149,373.23)/2] Average Equity)
* **Return on Assets (ROA):**  This requires the average total assets which is not directly given.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (Year Ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Gross Margin:** 36.3% (₹280,674.23 Gross Profit / ₹771,787.28 Revenue)
* **Operating Margin:** 3.8% (₹29,511.01 Operating Income / ₹771,787.28 Revenue)
* **Net Profit Margin:** 3.6% (₹27,418.48 Net Profit / ₹771,787.28 Revenue)
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 20.0% (₹27,418.48 Net Profit attributable to owners of the parent / [(₹124,148.78 + ₹149,813.54)/2] Average Equity )
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** This requires the average total assets which is not directly given.


**Important Notes:**

* **Rounding:** These calculations are based on the rounded figures provided in the annual report excerpt.  Using precise figures from the complete annual report may result in slightly different percentages.
* **Average Equity:** ROE is calculated using the average shareholders' equity for the year.  The average is calculated by adding the beginning and ending equity balances and dividing by two.
* **Average Total Assets:** ROA requires average total assets (beginning + ending balance / 2). This information was not directly available in the provided text.
* **Consolidated ROE:** The consolidated ROE calculation uses the net profit attributable to the owners of the parent company.  The non-controlling interest is excluded from this calculation.


Always refer to the original annual report for complete financial data and detailed notes to the financial statements for the most accurate calculations.

### Liquidity Ratios
The annual report provides the current ratio but not the quick ratio or cash ratio. We can calculate the current ratio using the provided data and will note why the others cannot be calculated from what's available.

**In Times:**

**Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Current Ratio:** 1.1 (₹435,661.71 Current Assets / ₹340,295.83 Current Liabilities)


**Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Current Ratio:** 1.1 (₹455,232.48 Current Assets / ₹353,801.72 Current Liabilities)


**Why Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio Cannot Be Calculated:**

The quick ratio and cash ratio require more detailed information than provided in the excerpt.  Here's why:

* **Quick Ratio:**  The quick ratio is (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities.  While current assets and current liabilities are given, the excerpt doesn't offer a precise breakdown of *all* current assets. Inventories are listed separately, but other current assets (like prepaid expenses or receivables that aren't trade receivables) might be included in the total current assets figure.  To calculate a precise quick ratio, these need to be subtracted from the total current assets.

* **Cash Ratio:** The cash ratio is (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities. While cash and cash equivalents are given, the excerpt doesn't fully detail the structure of current liabilities.  The precise total current liabilities figure includes trade payables, other current liabilities, and other items.  A precise cash ratio would require breaking down current liabilities into their components, which is not present in this excerpt.


To calculate the quick ratio and cash ratio accurately, consult the complete annual report which contains a detailed breakdown of all current assets and current liabilities.  The notes to the financial statements will provide the necessary information.



### Efficiency Ratios
The annual report provides some efficiency ratios, but not all of those requested.  Let's analyze what can be calculated and explain why others cannot be derived from the excerpt provided:


**Standalone Financial Statements (Year Ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** This can be approximated using the Cost of Goods Sold and average inventory.  The cost of goods sold is not directly given but can be approximated from the cost of revenue information (₹483,321.81).  The average inventory would be (₹56,819.74 + ₹68,304.54) / 2 = ₹62,562.14 Lakhs. Therefore:


    * **Approximated Inventory Turnover:** 7.7 times (₹483,321.81 Cost of Revenue / ₹62,562.14 Average Inventory)

* **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:** This can be calculated using net credit sales (approximated from Revenue) and average receivables:

    * **Approximated Receivables Turnover:** 6.76 times (₹754,211.45 Revenue / [(₹104,244.33 + ₹117,740.56) / 2] Average Receivables)

* **Asset Turnover Ratio:** This needs average total assets, which isn't explicitly given.  You would need to use the opening and closing balance sheet values of total assets to calculate this ratio.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (Year Ended March 31, 2024):**

* **Inventory Turnover Ratio:**  Similar to the standalone calculation, we need to approximate using the cost of revenue and average inventory. The consolidated cost of revenue is approximately ₹491,113.05 Lakhs. The average inventory is (₹57,700.13 + ₹68,427.22) / 2 = ₹63,063.68 Lakhs. Therefore:


    * **Approximated Inventory Turnover:** 7.8 times (₹491,113.05 / ₹63,063.68)

* **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:** Using the consolidated revenue and average receivables:

    * **Approximated Receivables Turnover:** 6.8 times (₹771,787.28 / [(₹108,022.51 + ₹121,142.86) / 2] Average Receivables)

* **Asset Turnover Ratio:** Requires average total assets, which is not directly given in the excerpt.


**Important Notes:**

* **Approximations:**  These calculations are based on approximations because not all necessary line items are explicitly listed in the excerpt. The complete financial statements are needed for the most accurate calculations.

* **Cost of Goods Sold:**  The cost of revenue is used as a proxy for cost of goods sold in the inventory turnover calculation.

* **Average Values:** Turnover ratios use average balances (beginning + ending balance /2).

* **Net Credit Sales:**  Revenue is used as a proxy for net credit sales in the receivables turnover calculation.  This is only precise if the majority of sales are on credit.


To obtain precise figures, refer to the complete financial statements and the associated notes in the original annual report.  The notes would clarify the composition of the relevant line items, offering a more accurate and reliable computation.



### Leverage Ratios
The annual report provides some use ratios but not all of those requested. Here's what we can calculate from the provided excerpt:


**In Times or Percentage:**

**Standalone Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** 0.6 (₹725 Total Debt / ₹1238 Average Shareholder Equity)  Note: Total debt (₹862 Lakhs) and average Shareholder Equity (₹1368 Lakhs) are approximations from the table.
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** This requires total assets (given) and total debt. Using the given approximate values (Total Assets: ₹581,979.58 Lakhs, Total Debt: ₹862 Lakhs):  Debt to asset ratio is approximately 0.15 (₹862 / ₹581,979.58).
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** 2.7  (₹446 EBITDA / ₹160 Finance Costs). Using approximate values from the table.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (as of March 31, 2024):**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** 0.6 (₹725 Total Debt / ₹1240 Average Shareholder Equity). Note: Total debt (₹862 Lakhs) and average Shareholder Equity (₹1240 Lakhs) are approximations from the table.
* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Using the approximate given values (Total Assets: ₹591,725.75 Lakhs, Total Debt: ₹862 Lakhs): Debt to asset ratio is approximately 0.15 (₹862/ ₹591,725.75)
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** 2.8 (₹463 EBITDA / ₹165 Finance Costs) Using approximate values from the table.


**Important Notes:**

* **Approximations:** These calculations use approximated values for total debt and average equity obtained from tables, as precise figures for debt and equity aren't explicitly available in the provided excerpt from the annual report. The complete financial statements are necessary for more precise computations.

* **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.
* **Average Equity:** The debt-to-equity ratio uses the average of the beginning and ending equity balances for the year.

To obtain precise use ratios, refer to the complete annual report and its accompanying notes for accurate values of total debt, equity, and EBITDA.  The notes to the financial statements provide a detailed breakdown of these figures.





## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided text gives some of the information needed to calculate these ratios, but not all. Here's what we can determine, along with explanations of what's missing:

**In Indian Rupees (₹) or Percentage (%)**

* **Market Capitalization:** ₹6,900 crore (approximately ₹69,000 Lakhs) as of May 28, 2024. This is explicitly stated in the report.

* **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E):** This requires the market price per share and earnings per share (EPS). The report provides an EPS of ₹15.9 but does not specify the market price per share on the date of reporting, May 28, 2024.   Therefore, the P/E ratio cannot be calculated from the provided information.

* **Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B):** This requires the market price per share and book value per share. The report gives the book value per share (₹87), but again, the market price per share at the relevant date is missing.  Therefore, the P/B ratio cannot be calculated.

* **Dividend Yield:** This requires the annual dividend per share and the market price per share. The report states a proposed dividend of ₹1.70 per share, but the market price per share at the relevant date is not specified. Therefore, the dividend yield cannot be calculated.

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** This can be calculated using the proposed dividend and net profit.   Using the standalone net profit (₹27,373.77 Lakhs) and total number of shares (171,787,584) to calculate the net profit per share, and the proposed dividend of ₹1.70 per share:


    * **Approximated Dividend Payout Ratio:** 10.67%  [(₹1.70 * 171,787,584) / (₹27,373.77 Lakhs * 100,000)]


**To calculate the P/E, P/B, and Dividend Yield:** You must consult the complete annual report and use the market price per share on May 28, 2024, the date the market capitalization is reported.

**Additional Note:**  The dividend payout ratio is calculated using the *proposed* dividend.  The actual payout ratio may differ if the proposed dividend is not approved by the shareholders.





## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The annual report provides some, but not all, of the information requested to fully characterize each business segment.  Market share data is not included in the report.  Let's summarize what is available:


**Business Segments (Year Ended March 31, 2024):**


It's important to note that the provided annual report excerpt does not offer a precise revenue breakdown for each segment within the Consolidated figures.  The standalone numbers are also not explicitly broken down by segment, but we can make some approximations using the order book percentages as proxies.

### Audit Information
The annual report includes two independent auditor's reports: one for the Standalone Financial Statements and another for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Both reports from **T R Chadha & Co LLP** express an **unqualified (unmodified) opinion**. This means the auditors found the financial statements to be fairly presented in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles.

The auditors highlight two key audit matters:

1. **Revenue Recognition:** The complexity of revenue recognition for long-term construction contracts, especially in estimating costs to complete and dealing with variable considerations (variations and claims).

2. **Recoverability of Receivables:** Assessing the recoverability of trade receivables and contract assets, especially those related to overdue milestones and unsettled invoices.

The auditors' report details the audit procedures employed to address these key matters.


**Key Accounting Policies:**

Several key accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements.  Here are some highlights:

* **Basis of Preparation:** The financial statements comply with Ind AS.  They are prepared using the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value.

* **Operating Cycle:** The operating cycle is defined as the time it takes to complete a project, including the defect liability period, and collect receivables.  This is relevant for classifying assets and liabilities as current or non-current.

* **Accounting Estimates:**  The preparation of financial statements requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that impact asset and liability values and revenue recognition. Key estimates include costs to complete contracts, the fair value of investments, deferred tax assets, and defined benefit obligations.

* **Fair Value Measurement:** Financial instruments are measured at fair value using a three-level hierarchy based on the observability of inputs.

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment:**  These assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

* **Intangible Assets:**  These assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.  The report specifies a useful life (5 years) for computer software.
