## Orient Cement Limited (FY 2023-24) Financial Analysis

### Revenue Analysis

*   Total income increased by approximately 8.5% YoY, reaching ₹3,200.61 crore in FY24 from ₹2,949.57 crore in FY23. Revenue from Operations grew similarly to ₹3,185.09 crore from ₹2,936.83 crore.
*   Sales volume grew by ~6% YoY to 61.3 lakh tonnes in FY24 from 57.6 lakh tonnes in FY23. Capacity utilization improved to 72% from 68% in FY23.
*   The Company operates primarily in a single segment: Manufacturing and Sale of Cement.
*   Growth was driven by the non-trade (B2B) segment, which saw a 19% volume increase, offsetting a 6% de-growth in the trade (B2C) segment. This shift was attributed to strong demand from the infrastructure sector.
*   Premium brand volumes grew by 31% YoY, reaching 21% of trade volume (up from 15% in FY23). However, the overall shift towards B2B led to a slight decrease in the blended cement sale proportion (55% in FY24 vs. 57% in FY23), as infrastructure projects typically require more Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC).
*   Operations are focused in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and South Gujarat. No export revenue was reported.

### Cost Structure Analysis

*   Power and Fuel: Decreased as a percentage of revenue from operations to 28.0% (₹893.25 cr) in FY24 from 32.5% (₹955.21 cr) in FY23. This improvement was driven by lower petcoke prices, increased alternative fuel usage (TSR reached 17%), and contribution from the newly commissioned WHRS phase 1 at Chittapur and solar power at Jalgaon.
*   Packing, Freight & Forwarding: Relatively stable as a percentage of revenue at 26.4% (₹841.86 cr) in FY24 compared to 26.6% (₹782.40 cr) in FY23.
*   Cost of Materials Consumed: Increased slightly as a percentage of revenue to 14.4% (₹459.87 cr) in FY24 from 13.8% (₹404.53 cr) in FY23.
*   Employee Benefits Expense: Remained stable at 5.7% (₹180.23 cr) in FY24 vs. 5.6% (₹165.78 cr) in FY23.
*   Other Expenses: Increased to 11.1% (₹353.99 cr) from 10.3% (₹302.20 cr), potentially driven by higher advertising/promotion (₹49.5 cr vs ₹38.6 cr) and repairs.
*   Finance Costs: Decreased significantly to 1.0% (₹30.73 cr) from 1.3% (₹37.13 cr) due to debt repayment.

### Profitability and Margin Analysis

*   EBITDA: Increased by 23% YoY to ₹464.75 crore in FY24 from ₹376.56 crore in FY23. EBITDA margin improved to 14.5% (based on total income) from 12.8% in FY23, driven by volume growth and lower fuel costs, despite softer cement prices.
*   Profit Before Tax (PBT): Grew by 47% YoY to ₹281.50 crore from ₹191.17 crore. PBT margin improved to 8.8% from 6.5%.
*   Net Profit (PAT): Increased by 42% YoY to ₹174.85 crore from ₹122.82 crore. Net Profit Margin improved to 5.5% from 4.2%.
*   Margins improved significantly YoY due to better operating leverage and cost management, particularly in energy. However, MD&A commentary notes that performance momentum slowed in the last four months of FY24 due to adverse market conditions.

### Operating Leverage

*   The Company demonstrated positive operating leverage in FY24. Revenue growth of 8.5% translated into significantly higher growth rates for EBITDA (23%), PBT (47%), and PAT (42%). This was primarily facilitated by volume increases and successful cost control measures, especially concerning power and fuel expenses.

### Non-Recurring Items

*   No major non-recurring items impacting operational comparability were explicitly highlighted in the provided report sections. A donation of ₹300 Lacs to an Electoral Trust was noted under Other Expenses. The softness in demand and prices during Q4 FY24 was mentioned as impacting the full-year results compared to earlier momentum.

### GAAP vs Non-GAAP Reconciliation

*   Financials are prepared under Ind AS (Indian GAAP equivalent).
*   EBITDA is a key non-GAAP measure used. A reconciliation based on the P&L statement shows: PBT (₹281.50 cr) + Finance Costs (₹30.73 cr) + Depreciation & Amortization (₹149.74 cr) = ₹461.97 cr. This closely approximates the reported EBITDA of ₹464.75 cr.

### Earnings Per Share (EPS) Analysis

*   **Basic EPS:** Increased by 42.2% to ₹8.53 in FY24 from ₹6.00 in FY23.
*   **Diluted EPS:** Increased by 42.2% to ₹8.53 in FY24 from ₹6.00 in FY23.
*   The growth in EPS mirrors the PAT growth, indicating no significant changes in the share base. Potential dilution from ESOPs was minimal/anti-dilutive.

### Quarterly Performance Commentary

*   The MD&A indicates significant fluctuations in demand and prices during FY24, with overall demand below expectations.
*   Q4 FY24 performance was noted as sub-par, lacking the typical high-demand, high-price scenario often seen in that quarter. This weakness in the latter part of the year impacted the full-year results despite strong performance until November 2023.

### Key Financial Ratios Summary

*   **Return on Net Worth:** Improved to 10.41% (FY24) from 7.93% (FY23).
*   **Debt Equity Ratio:** Improved significantly to 0.07 (FY24) from 0.24 (FY23), reflecting debt reduction. The company is nearly net debt-free.
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Improved to 10.17 (FY24) from 7.39 (FY23).
*   **Current Ratio:** Improved to 1.16 (FY24) from 0.93 (FY23).
*   **Turnover Ratios:** Debtors Turnover Ratio worsened (14.09 vs 17.23), and Inventory Turnover Ratio slightly worsened (9.14 vs 10.93).

## Orient Cement Limited FY 2023-24 Cash Management Analysis

### Cash Flow Analysis (OCF, ICF, FCF Components)

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Net cash flow from operating activities for FY24 stood at H 42,943.42 lacs, a significant increase from H 11,568.08 lacs in FY23. This improvement was primarily driven by higher Profit Before Tax (H 28,512.57 lacs vs H 19,331.45 lacs) and favorable movements in working capital, particularly a decrease in inventories (H 1,819.54 lacs change vs H -16,141.08 lacs change in FY23) and an increase in Trade Payables (H 1,384.27 lacs change vs H -1,734.24 lacs change in FY23), offsetting an increase in Trade Receivables (H -5,603.40 lacs change vs H -4,620.92 lacs change in FY23). Non-cash adjustments like depreciation (H 14,879.92 lacs) remained relatively stable.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash flow used in investing activities was H -8,121.88 lacs in FY24 compared to H -12,004.35 lacs in FY23. The primary outflow was Purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Intangibles amounting to H -7,820.87 lacs (FY23: H -13,006.17 lacs). FY24 included an investment in equity instruments of H 731.00 lacs related to the SPV for solar power plants. Interest received contributed H 640.58 lacs (FY23: H 600.38 lacs).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Net cash flow used in financing activities was H -33,166.61 lacs in FY24, compared to net cash flow from financing activities of H 3,958.91 lacs in FY23. Key activities included repayment of term loans (H -16,100.00 lacs vs H -14,500.00 lacs), net repayment of working capital loans (H -13,483.36 lacs vs proceeds of H 13,483.36 lacs), dividend payments (H -3,585.21 lacs vs H -4,609.54 lacs), and finance costs paid (H -3,018.49 lacs vs H -2,936.02 lacs). Proceeds from borrowings were significantly lower (H 3,462.31 lacs vs H 8,483.36 lacs).
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Calculated as OCF minus Capex (Purchase of PPE & Intangibles), FCF for FY24 was H 35,122.55 lacs (42,943.42 - 7,820.87), a substantial improvement over FY23's FCF of H -1,438.09 lacs (11,568.08 - 13,006.17). This turnaround is attributed to higher OCF generation and lower Capex during FY24.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   Inventory Turnover Ratio decreased from 11.08 in FY23 to 9.25 in FY24 (-16% change), suggesting slower inventory movement.
*   Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio decreased from 17.40 in FY23 to 14.21 in FY24 (-18% change), indicating slower collection of receivables.
*   Trade Payables Turnover Ratio remained relatively stable at 11.05 in FY24 compared to 11.14 in FY23 (-1% change).
*   The Current Ratio improved to 1.28 in FY24 from 1.03 in FY23 (+24% change), indicating better short-term liquidity.
*   MD&A commentary noted that higher B2B sales (with longer credit periods) and petcoke imports stretched working capital. Despite this, overall working capital management shows an improved Current Ratio, though turnover ratios indicate some slowing in inventory and receivables cycles.

### Capex Analysis

*   Total Capex (Purchase of PPE & Intangibles) for FY24 was H 7,820.87 lacs.
*   The company operates in a single reportable segment: Manufacturing and Sales of Cement. A segment-wise Capex breakdown is not applicable based on reported segments.
*   Key capital projects include the commissioning of the first phase of the Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) at Chittapur (10.1 MW), development of a fly-ash rake handling system at Chittapur, ongoing Colony expansion at Devapur, and preliminary work for the Rajasthan project. The Capex reflects investments in efficiency (WHRS), logistics (fly-ash system), and future growth (Rajasthan project).

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividends:**
    *   FY24: Paid an interim dividend of H 0.75 per share. Recommended a final dividend of H 1.50 per share. Total dividend for FY24 (if final approved) is H 2.25 per share.
    *   FY23: Paid an interim dividend of H 0.50 per share and a final dividend of H 1.00 per share. Total dividend for FY23 was H 1.50 per share.
    *   The total dividend payout for FY24 represents a 50% increase over FY23. The dividend distribution aligns with the company's stated Dividend Distribution Policy.
*   **Share Buyback:** The report indicates no share buyback activity during FY24 or the preceding five years.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) improved to 2.01x in FY24 from 1.68x in FY23 (+20% change).
*   Interest Coverage Ratio improved to 9.90x in FY24 from 7.25x in FY23 (+37% change).
*   The improvement in debt servicing capacity is supported by higher earnings (EBIT/PBT) and reduced debt levels following scheduled repayments and strong cash flow generation. The company is noted as being 'almost net debt-free'.

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

*   **Liquidity:** The Current Ratio improved significantly from 1.03 in FY23 to 1.28 in FY24. Cash and cash equivalents increased to H 7,466.15 lacs from H 6,679.97 lacs.
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** While not explicitly stated, the underlying turnover ratios suggest a potential lengthening of the CCC. DSO increased (lower receivables turnover), DIO increased (lower inventory turnover), while DPO remained stable (stable payables turnover). A calculation based on average balances and P&L figures would be needed for the precise CCC trend.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield Trends

*   **FCF Generation:** FCF showed a significant positive turnaround to H 35,122.55 lacs in FY24 from H -1,438.09 lacs in FY23, driven by stronger OCF and reduced Capex.
*   **FCF Yield:** Calculation requires market capitalization, which is not provided in the report text. Therefore, the FCF yield cannot be determined solely from the provided information. However, the trend in absolute FCF generation is strongly positive in FY24 compared to FY23.

## Orient Cement Limited - Financial Analysis (FY 2023-24)

### Profitability Analysis

*   **Revenue & Profit Growth:** Revenue from operations increased by approximately 8% YoY, reaching ₹3,185.09 crores in FY24 from ₹2,939.01 crores in FY23.

Profit Before Tax (PBT) rose 47% to ₹280.63 crores (FY23: ₹191.21 crores), and Profit After Tax (PAT) increased by 42% to ₹174.85 crores (FY23: ₹122.82 crores). This growth was attributed to a ~6% increase in sales volume (driven by non-trade/B2B sales which grew 19%, offsetting a 6% decline in trade/B2C sales) and improved realization per tonne due to a favorable product mix shift towards premium brands.
*   **Margins:**
    *   EBITDA margin improved to 14.59% in FY24 from 12.82% in FY23. This improvement was supported by higher volumes and lower fuel costs (lower petcoke prices, higher AFR usage, WHRS contribution), despite cost pressures from higher OPC sales mix required for infrastructure projects.
    *   Net Profit Margin increased to 5.47% in FY24 from 4.23% in FY23, reflecting the strong PBT growth flowing through after tax.
*   **Return Ratios:**
    *   Return on Equity (ROE) improved significantly to 10.41% in FY24 from 7.93% in FY23, driven by the 42% increase in PAT.
    *   Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) also showed improvement, rising to 14.28% in FY24 from 10.07% in FY23.
*   **Premiumization Impact:** Sales of premium products ('Birla.A1 OrientGreen', 'Birla.A1 StrongCrete', 'Birla.A1 Dolphin') grew 31% YoY and constituted 21% of trade volume in FY24, up from 15% in FY23. This strategic shift positively impacted overall margins.
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Basic EPS increased by 42% to ₹8.54 in FY24 from ₹6.00 in FY23. Diluted EPS followed suit at ₹8.53 (FY23: ₹6.00).

### Liquidity Analysis

*   **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** The Quick Ratio improved to 0.64 for FY24 from 0.47 in FY23. The improvement suggests better coverage of short-term liabilities by more liquid assets.
*   **Cash Ratio:** The Cash Ratio improved to 0.15 for FY24 from 0.11 in FY23. While low, the ratio shows a slight improvement in immediate liquidity.
*   **Working Capital:** Working capital was stretched due to higher B2B sales (longer credit periods) and pet coke imports late in the year.

### Efficiency Analysis

*   **Inventory Turnover:** The Inventory Turnover ratio decreased slightly to 9.27 times in FY24 from 11.08 times in FY23. This suggests slower inventory movement during the year. Average DIO likely increased.
*   **Debtors (Receivables) Turnover:** The Receivables Turnover ratio decreased to 14.20 times in FY24 from 17.42 times in FY23. This indicates a slowdown in collecting receivables, aligning with the MD&A comment about longer credit periods for B2B sales. Average DSO likely increased.

## Orient Cement Limited (OCL) - Financial Analysis FY 2023-24

### Revenue and Profitability

*   **Revenue Growth:** OCL reported Revenue from Operations of ₹3,185.09 crore in FY24, an 8% increase compared to ₹2,939.20 crore in FY23. Total income reached ₹3,200.61 crore (+9% YoY). This growth was primarily driven by a 6% increase in sales volume and improved realization per tonne due to a strategic shift towards premium products.
*   **Profitability Improvement:**
    *   EBITDA increased significantly by 23% to ₹464.75 crore (FY23: ₹376.56 crore). EBITDA margin improved to 14.59% from 12.82% in FY23.
    *   Profit After Tax (PAT) grew by 42% to ₹174.85 crore (FY23: ₹122.82 crore). Net Profit Margin improved to 5.47% from 4.23%.
*   **Drivers:** Profitability gains were attributed to higher volumes, enhanced realization from premium product sales, and effective cost management, particularly lower fuel costs. However, higher demand from the infrastructure sector requiring more Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) partially offset cost savings due to higher manufacturing costs associated with OPC.
*   **Dividend:** An interim dividend of ₹0.75 per share was paid. A final dividend of ₹1.50 per share has been recommended (Total FY24: ₹2.25 vs FY23: ₹1.50).

*   Specific disputed statutory dues totaling approximately ₹2,800.55 lacs (net of amounts paid under protest) are detailed in the CARO report, pending before various appellate authorities (High Courts, CESTAT, Commissioner Appeals etc.).

*   Management believes, based on internal assessment and legal counsel, that the demands in these disputed cases may not sustain, hence no provision is made. The timing of potential outflows is uncertain.
*   No significant or material orders impacting going concern status or future operations were reported. No proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code are pending.

### Related Party Transactions

*   All transactions with related parties during FY24 were conducted in the ordinary course of business and on an arm's length basis (Note 39, Board's Report).
*   No materially significant related party transactions requiring shareholder approval under Section 188 or Regulation 23 were reported.

*   Mr. Janat Shah ceased to be an Independent Director effective April 29, 2024, upon completion of his second term. Mr. Swapan Dasgupta was appointed Chairman of the CSR Committee effective April 30, 2024.
*   No other material changes or commitments affecting the financial position between March 31, 2024, and May 1, 2024, were reported.

### Accounting Quality Analysis

*   Accounting policies appear consistent with Ind AS requirements. The use of estimates for useful lives, provisions (mine restoration), defined benefit obligations, and ESOP valuation introduces subjectivity, but these are standard for the industry.
*   The identification of Revenue Recognition (discounts/rebates) as a Key Audit Matter highlights a significant area requiring management judgment and carrying potential estimation risk, impacting the certainty of reported revenue.
*   The Company's decision to remain under the older tax regime, foregoing the lower Section 115BAA rate to utilize MAT credits, reflects a specific tax planning strategy impacting current and deferred tax calculations.
*   Transparency is supported by detailed disclosures in notes, including segment reporting (though identified as single segment), related party transactions, contingent liabilities, and adherence to the BRSR framework. The modification noted in the audit trail function represents a minor gap in system controls related to accounting records.

### Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   The Company faces regulatory risk primarily related to environmental laws and mining regulations, given its core operations and expansion plans (Chittapur expansion pending Environmental Clearance). Compliance with pollution control norms and mining restoration obligations is critical.
*   Pending tax litigations across various statutes (Excise, Customs, VAT, Entry Tax, Income Tax, GST) represent a significant regulatory risk, with potential financial outflows if rulings are unfavorable, although management currently assesses the probability of loss as low.
*   Adherence to SEBI Listing Regulations and Companies Act provisions, particularly concerning Corporate Governance, ESOPs, and related party transactions, is crucial to avoid penalties. The Secretarial Audit and Corporate Governance reports indicate good compliance levels.
*   The requirement for accurate disclosures under MSMED Act regarding supplier dues carries compliance risk.
*   Changes in regulations, such as the upcoming Code on Social Security, 2020, may necessitate adjustments in employee benefit provisions and compliance procedures.
