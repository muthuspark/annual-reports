## Audit and Compliance Analysis

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   The Independent Auditor's Report provides an unqualified opinion on the Ind-AS financial statements, stating they give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards.
*   However, there's an observation in paragraph 2(b) and 2(h)(vi) of the 'Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements'. The Company maintained periodic backups of accounting records on servers in India, not daily backups, until December 17, 2023.
*   The auditors state that the audit trail feature was enabled and operational throughout the year, however, because of non-availability of audit trail data for the whole year, they are unable to comment for the period, where SOC reports or bridge letter has not been available.
*   There were delays in transferring amounts to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) due to technical errors at the MCA portal.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, on an accrual basis, and in accordance with Ind AS.
*   Revenue recognition is upon transfer of control of goods to customers, net of discounts and rebates.
*   The company has assessed recent accounting pronouncements (amendments to Ind AS 117, 103, and 101) and does not expect a significant impact.
*   No Changes in accounting policy as compared to prior year.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   The Auditor's Report (Annexure B) states that, in their opinion, the Company has an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to the Ind-AS financial statements, and such controls were operating effectively as of June 30, 2024.

*   The Company has complied with the corporate governance requirements of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.
*   No strictures or penalties were imposed on the Company by regulatory authorities related to capital markets in the past three years.
*   There are instances of non-compliance with the Companies Act, 2013 and Rules framed thereunder.

### Legal Proceedings and Potential Impact

*   The Company discloses the impact of pending litigations on its financial position in Note 36.
*   There are contingent liabilities related to income tax, sales tax, excise duty, service tax, custom duty, and Good and Services Tax matters that are pending before appellate authorities.
*   The Company is also a party to other legal proceedings, but the disclosure does not quantify these.
*   Total contingent liabilities amount to Rs. 60596 lakhs.

*   The Company has a Related Party Transaction Policy.
*   All related party transactions during the year were in the ordinary course of business and on an arm's length basis.
*   Material related party transaction was entered into with Procter & Gamble Home Products Private Limited for purchase of goods (Contract Manufacturing), Amounting to Rs. 729.50 Crores, approved by shareholder.

### Subsequent Events

*   The Board of Directors recommended a final dividend of ' 95 per equity share on August 28, 2024, subject to shareholder approval.

### Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The unqualified audit opinion suggests a high level of accounting quality. However, the observation of periodic only backup of accounting data until December 17, 2023 and that SOC reports for audit trail records were not available for full year raises a minor concern about data integrity.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The Company faces regulatory risk primarily related to pending tax litigations. The contingent liabilities for tax matters are significant, indicating potential financial impact if the outcomes are unfavorable. The delay in transferring funds to the IEPF, even though due to technical issues, needs to be noted. The non-daily backup of books before December 18, 2023, and the missing SOC reports for complete financial year highlight a compliance gap.
