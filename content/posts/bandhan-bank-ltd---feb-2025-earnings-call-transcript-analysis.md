### Guidance/Forecasts

*   NIMs expected to moderate further due to increasing share of secured assets. ROA target remains close to 2%. Near-term credit cost target ~2%, aiming for 1.5%-1.6% by FY27. Secured asset mix target of 55%+ by FY27.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

*   Banking sector facing tight liquidity and intense competition for deposits. Microfinance sector facing "headwinds and witnessing elevated risks in the portfolio quality." CASA growth is soft across the industry. Regulatory focus on MFI lending practices (e.g., Karnataka ordinance mentioned, though impact seen as low for Bandhan).
