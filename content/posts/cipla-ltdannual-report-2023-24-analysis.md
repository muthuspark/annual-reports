### Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

#### Accounting Quality

*   The consistent application of Ind AS, coupled with the unqualified auditor's opinion, suggests good accounting quality.
*   The use of estimates, particularly for sales returns, discounts, rebates, and provisions, introduces an element of subjectivity that requires careful monitoring.

#### Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated, with numerous governing bodies and laws that relate to manufacturing, quality, product pipeline, and sales. While the Company declares compliance with relevant regulations, there are ongoing disputes with the NPPA regarding drug pricing. This represents a significant regulatory risk, given the substantial amounts involved and potential financial implications.
*   The regulatory risk is high due to the Company's operations in a highly regulated industry and the ongoing litigation with the NPPA.
