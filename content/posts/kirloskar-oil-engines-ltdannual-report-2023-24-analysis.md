    *   **Net FCF:** ₹130.90 crore (FY24), ₹(25.65) crore (FY23). Significant increase mainly is on account of proceeds from bill discounting and borrowings.

#### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   The report provides details on changes in working capital components (inventories, trade receivables, trade payables, etc.) within the cash flow statement. A thorough analysis would require comparing these changes against revenue growth. The Consolidated Balance Sheet shows Current Assets grew by 9.9% and Current Liabilities grew by 16.9%. This divergence can mean that efficiency of working capital management is lower.

#### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividends:**
    *   FY24: Interim dividend of ₹2.50 per share (125%) and a proposed final dividend of ₹3.50 per share (175%), totaling a 350%.
    *   FY23: Interim dividend of ₹2.50 per share (125%) and final of H 2.50 (125%).
    *   The trend indicates a consistent dividend payout, with an increase in the proposed final dividend for FY24.

*   **Share Buyback:** The report does not mention any share buyback programs during the FY23-24 or the prior year.

#### Debt Service Coverage

* Debt Service Coverage ratio is 3.44 in FY24, lower than the one from FY23(4.91)
* The increase in Debt, and associated costs can be seen as the cause.

#### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Liquidity Position:**
    *   The company has a strong, positive net cash position, excluding debt, of ₹269 crore, which includes treasury investments.
    *   The current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) for the consolidated entity is 1.48, and 1.57 on standalone basis. It is showing good liquidity.

*   **Cash Conversion Cycle:** However, the days of accounts payable can be calculated, and it equals 59.52 days.

## Risk Analysis Report: Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited (KOEL) - FY 2023-24

## Strategic Risks

*   **Risk Description:** Risks related to KOEL's overall business strategy, market position, and long-term goals, including competition, and changing customer preferences, government policies. The main stated strategy is the "2X3Y" plan to double FY22 revenue within three years.
*   **Severity:** High. Failure to achieve strategic goals can significantly impact market share, profitability, and shareholder value. The CPCB IV+ deadline change illustrates this.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. The Indian economy is growing, but competition and technological shifts are constant threats.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. The power generation sector is undergoing rapid transformation with a focus on cleaner technologies and alternative fuels, requiring significant adaptation.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Diversifying product portfolio (e.g., OptiPrime, expansion into high horsepower segments, and alternate fuel engines).
    *   Focusing on R&D for in-house product development (e.g., CPCB IV+ compliant Gensets).
    *   Expanding international presence (e.g., acquisition of Wildcat Power Gen, GOEM in MENA region).
    *   Continuous monitoring of market trends, and government policies.
    *   Strengthing relationship with stakeholders.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially Effective. KOEL has demonstrated agility in adapting to regulatory changes (CPCB IV+), but long-term success of diversification and expansion is yet to be proven.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** High. Failure to adapt could lead to significant revenue loss and reduced profitability. Success in new ventures could lead to substantial revenue growth (as per 2X3Y target).
*   **Quantitative Risk Metrics:**
    *   Revenue growth vs. 2X3Y target (FY24 growth was 18%, below target).
    *   Market share in key segments (data not fully provided, but stated to be the highest number of IoT Connected DG Sets).
    *   R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue (FY24: 3.6%, increased from 2.1% in FY23, indicating commitment).
*   **Year-over-Year Change:** Risk profile is likely increasing due to the accelerating pace of change in the industry, but mitigation efforts are also intensifying.

## Operational Risks

*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Medium to High. Production delays or quality issues can lead to increased costs, lost sales, and reputational damage.
*   **Quantitative Risk Metrics:**
    *   Production output vs. targets (Kagal plant delivered the highest number of DV Engines in a single month).
    *   Line efficiency and first-time pass rates (Kagal plant: >85% efficiency, 99.4% straight pass rate).
    *   Accident rates (zero reportable accidents at Kagal plant for over 3800 days).
    *   Employee attrition rate (12.5%, reduced by 3.3% in FY24).
*   **Year-over-Year Change:** Risk profile is likely stable or slightly decreasing due to ongoing improvement initiatives.

## Financial Risks

*   **Risk Description:** Risks related to KOEL's financial stability, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency fluctuations, and interest rate changes.
