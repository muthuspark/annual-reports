### Risk Landscape & Mitigation

*   **Cybersecurity & Data Privacy:** Acknowledged as a critical risk. Mitigation includes a zero-trust approach, advanced security tools (EDR, SSE, SIEM, VAPT), adherence to frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS), ISO certifications (27001, 22301), supplier security protocols, regular audits, and employee training. Global data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA, DPDP Act) is actively managed.
*   **Talent Acquisition & Retention:** Risk identified due to high demand for new-age skills (AI, Cloud). Mitigation involves expanding into Tier-2 cities, robust employee referral programs, campus hiring (Mavericks, Segue), continuous upskilling via HexaVarsity & SONIC, strong R&R programs (including the 'Navigator' long-service awards), and fostering an inclusive, employee-first culture ('WEAVE' engagement program).
*   **Revenue Concentration:** Top 10 clients contributed 35.8% of revenue (down from 35.5% in FY2023). Americas contributed 74.0% of revenue. Mitigation involves geographic diversification (focus on Europe, APAC, Middle East) and expanding the client base while deepening relationships with existing large clients (USD 20Mn+ accounts grew from 3 to 14 in four years; first USD 100Mn+ account secured in FY2024).
*   **Economic & Geopolitical Uncertainty:** Acknowledged ongoing risks (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions). Mitigation focuses on operational efficiency, cost management, prudent financial policies, and geographic/service diversification.
*   **Foreign Exchange Fluctuations:** Significant revenue earned in foreign currency exposes the company to rate risks. Mitigation involves a structured hedging program approved by the Board, using foreign currency forward contracts based on a graded approach considering time horizons.

    *   **Asia Pacific (APAC):** Contributed 6.2% of revenue (INR 7,486 million), growing 5.6% in USD terms YoY.

### Cost Structure Analysis

*   **Employee Benefit Expenses:** Consolidated employee costs (excluding ESOP) rose 12.2% YoY to INR 78,317 million in FY24 from INR 69,752 million in FY23. As a percentage of revenue, this decreased from 67.2% in FY23 to 65.4% in FY24, indicating improved employee cost efficiency relative to revenue growth. ESOP-related compensation costs increased from INR 264 million to INR 454 million.
*   **Operations and Other Expenses:** These expenses (excluding exceptional items) increased by 18.2% YoY to INR 30,700 million in FY24 from INR 25,974 million in FY23. As a percentage of revenue, this increased slightly from 25.0% in FY23 to 25.6% in FY24. Key drivers mentioned include subcontracting charges, software license costs, legal & professional fees, and travel & conveyance.
*   **Depreciation and Amortization:** Increased marginally to INR 2,799 million in FY24 from INR 2,736 million in FY23.

### Margin Analysis

*   **Adjusted EBITDA:** Adjusted EBITDA increased by 23.2% YoY to INR 20,765 million in FY24 from INR 16,852 million in FY23. The Adjusted EBITDA margin improved significantly by 111 basis points (bps) to 17.3% in FY24 from 16.2% in FY23. This improvement was attributed to better price realization, operational efficiencies, a favorable offshore revenue mix, a streamlined pyramid structure, and optimized labor footprint through expansion into Tier 2 locations.
*   **Profit Before Tax (PBT):** PBT grew 23.0% YoY to INR 15,603 million in FY24 from INR 12,675 million in FY23.
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT):** PAT increased by 17.7% YoY to INR 11,740 million in FY24 from INR 9,976 million in FY23. The PAT margin was 9.8% in FY24 compared to 9.6% in FY23, showing a slight improvement.

### Operating Leverage

The data indicates operating leverage. Revenue grew by 15.4%, while Adjusted EBITDA grew faster at 23.2%, and PBT grew at 23.0%. This suggests that as revenue increases, profits (before certain costs like tax and interest) increase at a faster rate, likely due to efficiencies gained and controlled cost growth relative to revenue expansion. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin from 16.2% to 17.3% further supports this observation.

### Non-Recurring / Exceptional Items

The MD&A details several exceptional costs impacting FY24 results compared to FY23:

*   **Employee Costs:** Included non-recurring employee benefit/severance costs (INR 465m vs INR 66m in FY23) and ERP Transformation costs (INR 468m vs NIL in FY23).
*   **Other Expenses:** Included ERP Transformation costs (Travel: INR 25m, Legal/Professional: INR 258m, Software Licenses: INR 107m - compared to varying amounts or NIL in FY23), Acquisition related costs (INR 334m vs INR 75m), and IPO related costs (INR 7m vs NIL). Provision for onerous vendor contracts related to lease agreements (INR 76m vs NIL) and regulatory fees (INR 170m vs NIL) were also noted. FY23 included specific provisions for onerous vendor contracts (INR 140m for communication, INR 58m for miscellaneous) and lifetime expected credit loss (INR 323m) which were not repeated at the same scale or nature in FY24.
*   **Depreciation/Amortization:** FY23 included accelerated amortization on ROU assets (INR 233m) due to office optimization, not specified for FY24. Amortization of intangibles from business combinations was INR 754m in FY24 vs INR 578m in FY23.

These items significantly impacted reported figures compared to underlying operational performance reflected in adjusted metrics like Adjusted EBITDA.

### GAAP vs Non-GAAP Reconciliation

The report emphasizes Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance indicator.

*   **Reported EBITDA (FY24):** INR 18,058 million
*   **Adjustments:** ESOP Cost (INR 454m), Exceptional Items (INR 1,740m), Other Income excl. FX gain/loss (INR 518m)
*   **Adjusted EBITDA (FY24):** INR 20,765 million (17.3% margin)
*   **Reported EBITDA (FY23):** INR 14,788 million
*   **Adjustments:** ESOP Cost (INR 264m), Exceptional Items (INR 783m), Other Income excl. FX gain/loss (INR 224m)
*   **Adjusted EBITDA (FY23):** INR 16,852 million (16.2% margin)

The adjustments highlight the impact of non-operational or non-cash items like ESOP costs and exceptional expenses (primarily related to ERP transformation, acquisition, and IPO in FY24) on reported profitability. Adjusted EBITDA provides a clearer view of underlying operational performance trends, showing a notable margin improvement YoY.

### EPS Analysis

*   **Basic EPS (FY24):** INR 18.47, an increase of 17.7% from INR 15.69 in FY23.
*   **Diluted EPS (FY24):** INR 18.28, compared to INR 15.68 in FY23.
*   **Adjusted Basic EPS (FY24):** INR 22.67 (excluding exceptional items and related tax), an increase of 21.4% from INR 18.67 in FY23.

The growth in EPS, both basic/diluted and adjusted, aligns with the overall profit growth achieved during the year.

## Cash Management Analysis: Hexaware Technologies Limited (FY24)

### Cash Flow Analysis

#### Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

The Group generated INR 15,480 million from operations in FY24, a slight increase from INR 15,156 million in FY23. This was primarily driven by Profit Before Tax of INR 15,603 million, adjusted for non-cash charges like depreciation & amortization (INR 2,788 million) and employee stock option costs (INR 353 million). Working capital adjustments included a significant outflow from increased trade receivables and other assets (INR -4,347 million), partially offset by inflows from increased trade payables, other liabilities, and provisions (INR 3,718 million). OCF conversion stood at 82.3% of reported EBITDA, indicating healthy operational cash generation despite working capital pressures.

#### Investing Cash Flow (ICF)

Net cash used in investing activities was INR 6,680 million in FY24, compared to INR 2,886 million in FY23. Key outflows included the acquisition of Softcrylic (net INR 8,268 million) and purchases of PPE & Intangibles (INR 1,333 million). Investment activities also included the purchase (INR 178,050 million) and subsequent sale/redemption (INR 18,686 million) of mutual funds, indicating active treasury management. Interest received provided a minor inflow (INR 244 million).

#### Financing Cash Flow (FCF)

Net cash used in financing activities amounted to INR 6,818 million in FY24 (FY23: INR 7,501 million). Major outflows were dividend payments (INR 5,314 million) and payments towards lease liabilities (INR 1,370 million). Proceeds from short-term borrowings (INR 2,830 million) were offset by repayments (INR 2,830 million). Proceeds from the issue of shares under ESOP were minimal (INR 1 million).

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

The company reported Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) at 47 days for FY24, stated as being the best in the industry. This indicates efficient collection of receivables.

The Current Ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) decreased from 1.95 in FY23 (INR 42,017 Mn / INR 21,558 Mn) to 1.55 in FY24 (INR 45,511 Mn / INR 29,412 Mn). While still above 1, the decline suggests tighter short-term liquidity, potentially influenced by the increase in current liabilities (including contract liabilities and other financial liabilities related to acquisitions).

### Capital Expenditure (Capex) Analysis

Total Capex for FY24, represented by the purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) and Intangible Assets, amounted to INR 1,333 million (Consolidated Cash Flow Statement).

Major investments were directed towards laptops for employees and establishing a new development center in Pune.

### Dividend and Shareholder Returns

The Company demonstrated a commitment to returning value to shareholders, distributing 43% of Profit After Tax (PAT) as dividends in FY24.

Total interim dividends paid during FY24 amounted to INR 5,314 million (INR 8.75 per share pre-split, equivalent to INR 4.375 per share post-split).

### Debt Service Coverage

An approximation using Adjusted EBITDA / Finance Costs (INR 20,735 Mn / INR 660 Mn) yields a ratio of approximately 31.4x. This suggests a very strong capacity to cover finance costs from operational earnings, although this proxy doesn't account for principal repayments. The company has minimal borrowings outside of lease liabilities.

### Liquidity Position

The Group maintained a healthy cash position, ending FY24 with Cash and Cash Equivalents of INR 18,734 million (up from INR 16,734 million in FY23). Including other bank balances, the total is INR 18,841 million.

The Current Ratio stands at 1.55, indicating sufficient coverage of short-term liabilities by short-term assets, although lower than the previous year's 1.95.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield

Free Cash Flow (FCF), calculated as OCF minus Capex, for FY24 is INR 14,147 million (INR 15,480 Mn - INR 1,333 Mn). This represents strong cash generation available after reinvestment in operational assets.

Relating this FCF to the approximate market capitalization at the time of the IPO (February 2024, ~INR 430,000 million), suggests an FCF yield of approximately 3.3% (14,147 / 430,000).
