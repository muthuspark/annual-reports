#### Comparisons

*   Q4 revenue growth (7% YoY) was slower than the full year (9.5% YoY) and initial mid-teens aspiration.
*   EBITDA growth significantly outpaced revenue growth due to controlled expenses (OpEx +1.7% YoY in Q4, Employee cost +0.9% YoY in Q4).
*   Collections growth accelerated significantly in Q4 (11.3% YoY) compared to the first three quarters ("6%, 7% kind of levels").
*   FY'25 effective tax rate (ETR) was low at 12% due to deferred tax reversals on treasury assets shifting to long-term.

#### Guidance/Forecasts

*   FY'26 ETR expected to normalize to "20%, 21% levels".
*   Aspiration to accelerate top-line growth in FY'26 towards "mid-teens kind of number" while maintaining similar strong margin levels (around 29%+).
*   Advertising spend guidance for FY26: "around 2.5% to 3% of the top line".

#### Areas of Growth/Decline

*   Strong growth in profitability (EBITDA, PBT, PAT) driven by margin expansion and cost control.
*   Healthy growth in traffic (especially mobile) and listings.
*   Accelerated collections growth in Q4 is a positive indicator.
*   Revenue growth for FY25 was below initial expectations. Paid campaign growth (5.1% YoY) lags traffic growth.

### Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

#### Major Strategic Announcements

*   Shift in sales strategy: Reduced focus on "cold calling" telesales, increased focus on teams working "qualified leads" generated via advertising, leading to higher productivity.
*   Focus on efficiency and profitable growth.
*   Planned acceleration of top-line growth through advertising (users and merchants) and "adequate price increases in underpriced categories and geographies."

#### New Products/Services/Markets

*   **Online Shopping Initiative:** Planning to launch a beta version next quarter. Positioned as an aggregator for businesses with existing online shopping capabilities (B2C & B2B), directing traffic to their sites. Monetization planned via sponsored listings initially, potentially moving to commission/referral later.
*   **Dynamic Pricing for Non-Premium Listings:** Moving from geography-based pricing to dynamic pricing based on keyword/category for non-premium listings (which contribute ~50% revenue).
*   **AI Integration:** Using AI for review summaries, prompting quality user reviews, merchant content creation (catalog descriptions, image enhancement), creating short videos/reels from merchant portfolios, and scoring sales leads.

#### Significant Operational Changes

*   Rationalization of the "bottom 10%, 20% of the sales team" and elimination of the "cold calling telesales team".
*   Potential increase in advertising spend, possibly including non-digital channels like multiplexes.

#### Ongoing/Completed Projects

*   Focus on improving B2B monetization: While B2B traffic share is increasing (~20%), revenue contribution remains stable (~26.5%). Focus is on improving realization.
*   Enhancing listing richness: Adding more service catalogs, videos, and rich content to listings.

### Market & Competitive Landscape

#### Industry Trends

*   Management noted the global focus on "businesses with positive unit economics, businesses with high returns". Also acknowledged the dynamic nature of SME advertising where businesses frequently enter/exit platforms or adjust spend seasonally.

#### Competitive Positioning

*   Management defended Just Dial's comprehensive local search focus in India when challenged regarding competition (Google, IndiaMART) and data accuracy.
*   The new online shopping initiative appears positioned as an aggregator/traffic driver rather than a direct e-commerce competitor initially.

#### Market Challenges/Opportunities

*   Macro environment and events like elections/festivals impacted FY25 collections initially.
*   Opportunity seen in increasing realization through dynamic pricing and targeting underpriced segments.
*   Significant opportunity in Tier 2/3 cities where realization is lower than Tier 1.
*   B2B monetization remains an opportunity given rising traffic share.

#### Market Share/Positioning Comments

*   Top 11 cities contribute 56.5% of revenue (down slightly from 58% YoY) but only 40% of campaign volume (stable YoY), indicating higher realization in top cities. B2B traffic share growing towards 20%.

### Risk Factors & Challenges

#### Acknowledged Concerns/Challenges

*   FY'25 top-line growth missed initial mid-teens target.
*   Delay in finalizing and communicating the capital allocation policy (dividend/buyback) despite previous indications.
*   Analyst feedback regarding defunct numbers and search result inaccuracy.
