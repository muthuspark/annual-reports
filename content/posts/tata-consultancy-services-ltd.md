## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis looks into TCS's Integrated Annual Report for FY2024 (ending March 31, 2024), covering financial performance, business segments, risk factors, and ESG initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance Overview:**

TCS delivered strong financial results in FY2024, despite global macroeconomic headwinds.  Key highlights include:

* **Revenue:** ₹240,893 crore (US$ 29.1 billion), a 6.8% YoY growth (3.4% in constant currency).  This growth was slower than the previous year (17.6%) due to reduced discretionary spending by clients and completion of some earlier projects.
* **Operating Margin:** 24.6%, a slight increase from 24.1% in FY23, demonstrating operational efficiency. The Q4 operating margin reached 26%, indicating a commitment to the 26-28% target band.
* **Net Margin:** 19.3%
* **Net Profit:** ₹46,099 crore (attributable to shareholders), a 10.5% YoY growth.
* **EPS:** ₹127.74, a 10.9% YoY increase.
* **Shareholder Payout:** ₹47,445 crore (the largest to date), including a final dividend of ₹28 per share (total dividend ₹73), and a ₹17,000 crore share buyback.

**Key Financial Ratios (10-year trend provided in the report):**

The report includes a detailed 10-year ratio analysis covering:

* **IP Infringement and Leakage:** Protected through robust IP management framework and stringent internal controls.
* **Climate Change:** Physical risks (extreme weather events) and transition risks (regulations, market shifts). Mitigated by green initiatives, business continuity plans, and renewable energy adoption.
* **Currency Volatility:** Mitigated by currency hedging policies.


**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

TCS demonstrates a strong commitment to ESG principles, with initiatives aligned to UN SDGs:

* **Environmental Sustainability:**  Focuses on carbon footprint reduction (80% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions vs. 2016 baseline, exceeding 2025 target), water conservation, waste reduction & recycling (ZWL certification achieved for a facility), and biodiversity conservation.

Its diversified business model, focus on innovation, proactive risk management, and strong commitment to ESG initiatives position it well for continued growth and sustainability in the long term.  However, the report also highlights the challenges posed by macroeconomic factors, talent acquisition, and evolving regulatory landscapes, requiring continued vigilance and adaptation.  The detailed financial data and ratio analysis provide valuable insights into the company's performance, while the detailed ESG disclosures demonstrate its dedication to responsible business practices.

**Important Note:**  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest crore.  The report also shows comparative figures for March 31, 2023.  The significant difference between standalone and consolidated figures reflects the inclusion of subsidiary companies' financial data in the consolidated statements.

### Liability Analysis
Again, the report provides both consolidated and standalone figures. Here's the breakdown of the requested liability values for both:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹74,344 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹46,104 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Long-Term Debt:** This is not explicitly stated as a single line item.  However, the components of long-term debt are included within "Non-Current Liabilities":
    * **Financial Liabilities (long-term):** ₹6,203 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Lease Liabilities (long-term):** ₹1,564 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Other Financial Liabilities (long-term):** ₹3,403 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Unearned and Deferred Revenue (long-term):** ₹365 crore (as of March 31, 2024)  This represents billings received for services not yet delivered.

* **Accounts Payable:** ₹9,981 crore (as of March 31, 2024). This is broken down further in Note 8(g) by maturity period.


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹48,727 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹43,061 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
* **Long-Term Debt:**  Similar to the consolidated statements, long-term debt is not a single line item but is represented by components within "Non-Current Liabilities":
    * **Lease Liabilities (long-term):** ₹5,128 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Other Financial Liabilities (long-term):** ₹315 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Employee Benefit Obligations (long-term):** ₹144 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Deferred Tax Liabilities (net):** ₹154 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Unearned and Deferred Revenue (long-term):** ₹226 crore (as of March 31, 2024)


* **Accounts Payable:**  ₹14,599 crore (as of March 31, 2024). This includes dues to small enterprises and micro enterprises (₹79 crore).

**Important Note:**  These figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest crore.  The report also shows comparative figures for March 31, 2023. The discrepancies between standalone and consolidated figures arise because the consolidated figures encompass the financial positions of all subsidiary companies.  Also note that "long-term debt" is inferred from the provided notes as it's not explicitly labeled as such in the balance sheet.  The components listed above are considered long-term based on their stated maturities.

### Equity Analysis
Here's a breakdown of the shareholders' equity, retained earnings, and share capital values from both the consolidated and standalone financial statements:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Total Equity:** ₹91,319 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Equity attributable to shareholders of the Company:** ₹90,127 crore (as of March 31, 2024). This includes:
        * **Share Capital:** ₹362 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
        * **Retained Earnings:** ₹70,033 crore (as of March 31, 2024).  Note that this value includes many other equity components (Capital Reserve, Capital Redemption Reserve, Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve, Investment Revaluation Reserve, Cash Flow Hedging Reserve, Foreign Currency Translation Reserve).
    * **Non-controlling Interests:** ₹1,192 crore (as of March 31, 2024)


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Total Equity:** ₹72,120 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Share Capital:** ₹362 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Retained Earnings:** ₹55,173 crore (as of March 31, 2024).  Note that similar to the consolidated statement, this value comprises retained earnings and many other equity components (Capital Reserve, Capital Redemption Reserve, Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve, Investment Revaluation Reserve, Cash Flow Hedging Reserve).


**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.
* The standalone figures represent only TCS Limited's equity, while the consolidated figures include the equity of all subsidiaries.
* The "Retained Earnings" figures shown above are simplified representations. The actual "Retained Earnings" line item in the financial statements is adjusted to include other detailed income. The detailed breakdown of these other equity components is available in Note 11 (Consolidated) and Note 9 (Standalone) of their respective financial statements.  These components represent various adjustments and reserves, not just accumulated profits.

Therefore, for a precise understanding of the various reserve components, careful review of Notes 11 and 9, as mentioned above, are crucial.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
The annual report provides both standalone and consolidated figures.  Here's the breakdown of the requested income statement values, for both:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹240,893 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Cost of Revenue:**  The report does not explicitly separate "Cost of Revenue" as a line item.  Instead, it presents "Employee benefit expenses" and "Other expenses" as the primary cost categories.  These, along with depreciation and amortization, are typically considered cost of services for an IT services company.  Therefore:
    * **Employee Benefit Expenses:** ₹140,131 crore
    * **Other Expenses:** ₹32,764 crore (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization)
    * **Depreciation & Amortization:** ₹4,985 crore
    * **Total Cost of Services (inferred):** ₹177,880 crore (₹140,131 + ₹32,764 + ₹4,985)
* **Gross Profit (inferred):** ₹62,013 crore (₹240,893 - ₹177,880)
* **Operating Expenses:**  ₹177,880 crore (as calculated above)  This includes Employee benefits expense, cost of equipment and software licences, finance costs, depreciation and amortization and other expenses.
* **Operating Income:** ₹63,013 crore (₹240,893 - ₹177,880)  (This differs slightly from EBIT due to how certain items are reported.)


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹202,359 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Cost of Revenue:** Similar to the consolidated statement, a separate "Cost of Revenue" line item isn't explicitly provided.  Instead, we can infer it:
    * **Employee Benefit Expenses:** ₹103,139 crore
    * **Other Expenses:** ₹40,026 crore (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization)
    * **Depreciation & Amortization:** ₹3,887 crore
    * **Total Cost of Services (inferred):** ₹147,052 crore (₹103,139 + ₹40,026 + ₹3,887)
* **Gross Profit (inferred):** ₹55,307 crore (₹202,359 - ₹147,052)
* **Operating Expenses:** ₹147,052 crore (as calculated above)
* **Operating Income:** ₹55,307 crore (₹202,359 - ₹147,052)


**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest crore.
* "Cost of Revenue," "Gross Profit," and "Operating Income" are inferred calculations based on the provided data.  The report uses different terminology and categorization for expenses.  Slight discrepancies might occur depending on how certain items are classified in the original statements.
* The standalone figures only reflect the financial performance of TCS Limited, while the consolidated figures include all subsidiary companies.

To obtain precise figures, a direct examination of the income statements within the annual report is recommended.


### Bottom Line Metrics
The annual report presents both standalone and consolidated figures.  Here's the breakdown of the requested values:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income (Profit Attributable to Shareholders):** ₹45,908 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** ₹59,311 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024).  This is calculated from the statement of profit and loss.
* **Basic EPS:** ₹125.88 (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹125.88 (Year ended March 31, 2024).  The report indicates no potentially dilutive securities.


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income (Profit Attributable to Shareholders):** ₹43,559 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **EBITDA:** This is not explicitly provided in the standalone statement.  It would need to be calculated from the standalone statement of profit and loss by adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense.
* **Basic EPS:** ₹119.44 (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹119.44 (Year ended March 31, 2024).  The report again indicates no potentially dilutive securities.


**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore or paisa as shown in the report.
* The standalone figures reflect only the performance of TCS Limited, whereas the consolidated figures incorporate the results of all its subsidiaries.  The significant difference between the standalone and consolidated net income highlights the contribution of subsidiaries to the overall group performance.


Remember that these values are extracted from the provided text, which is a transcription of the annual report.  For absolute precision, consult the original, certified financial statements within the report itself.

### Cash Flow Components
The annual report provides both consolidated and standalone cash flow statements. Here's a summary of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows for both:

**Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:**

* **Cash Flows from Operating Activities:** ₹44,338 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Cash Flows from Investing Activities:** ₹10,807 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Cash Flows from Financing Activities:** ₹(48,536) crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)  The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow.


**Standalone Statement of Cash Flows:**

* **Cash Flows from Operating Activities:** ₹39,142 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Cash Flows from Investing Activities:** ₹10,807 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)
* **Cash Flows from Financing Activities:** ₹(47,793) crore (Year ended March 31, 2024).  The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow.


**Important Notes:**

* All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest crore.
* The standalone statement reflects only the cash flows of TCS Limited, while the consolidated statement includes the cash flows of all its subsidiaries.  The substantial difference in financing cash flows between the standalone and consolidated statements is primarily due to the consolidated statement reflecting the activities of subsidiaries. The large negative cash flow from financing activities in both statements is mainly due to significant dividend payouts and share buyback.
* For precise details including the individual components of each cash flow category, refer to the respective statements within the full annual report.  The provided text transcription contains summarized values only.


### Cash Flow Metrics
The annual report doesn't directly provide a single line item for "Free Cash Flow." However, we can calculate it and find the other values you requested using the information provided in the cash flow statements and notes:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Free Cash Flow (Calculated):** To calculate free cash flow, we subtract Capital Expenditure from Cash Flow from Operating Activities.

    * **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹44,338 crore
    * **Capital Expenditure:**  This is not explicitly stated as a single figure, but can be derived from investing activities: ₹(1,720) crore for property, plant, and equipment; ₹(17) crore for right-of-use assets; ₹(442) crore for intangible assets.  The total is approximately ₹(2,179) crore.  (Note:  This assumes that all investing activity is Capital Expenditure.  It might exclude some items.)
    * **Free Cash Flow (Calculated):** ₹46,517 crore (₹44,338 - ₹(2,179))


* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) (Inferred):** Approximately ₹(2,179) crore (as calculated above).  This is not a directly stated value.
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹25,137 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Free Cash Flow (Calculated):**

    * **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹39,142 crore
    * **Capital Expenditure (Inferred):**  Similar to the consolidated statement, this is not a single line item but can be approximated from investing activities: ₹(1,720) crore.  Other significant investing activities are likely not CAPEX.
    * **Free Cash Flow (Calculated):** ₹37,422 crore (₹39,142 - ₹(1,720))


* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) (Inferred):** Approximately ₹(1,720) crore (as calculated above)
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹25,137 crore (Year ended March 31, 2024)


**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.  Free Cash Flow is a calculated value.  The precise calculation might differ depending on how certain items are classified in the original financial statements.
* The standalone figures relate only to TCS Limited, while the consolidated figures include all subsidiaries.
* The 'Capital Expenditure' values are inferred from the cash flow statements' investing activities section. Other cash outflows related to investments might not be considered as CAPEX (e.g., proceeds from disposal of investments).  The precise number for CAPEX needs to be verified from the notes to the financial statements of the company.  The number mentioned here could thus be slightly different than the certified value of CAPEX.

To obtain completely accurate figures, a direct review of the cash flow statements and related notes within the original annual report is highly recommended.



### Profitability Ratios
Calculating precise profitability ratios requires the exact figures from the certified financial statements.  While the report provides some key margin figures, others need calculation.  Also, remember that the report provides both standalone and consolidated numbers.  Here's what we can infer, with the important caveat that these are *approximations* based on the data provided in the transcription:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹240,893 crore
* **Gross Profit (Inferred):** ₹62,013 crore (This is calculated by subtracting the inferred cost of services from Revenue)
* **Gross Margin (Inferred):** 25.7% (₹62,013 crore / ₹240,893 crore)
* **Operating Margin:** 24.6% (This is explicitly stated in the report)
* **Net Profit Margin (Inferred):** 19.1% (₹45,908 crore / ₹240,893 crore)
* **ROE (Return on Equity) (Inferred):**  This requires the average shareholder's equity for the year.  The report doesn't provide this directly.  Assuming an average of approximately ₹85,000 crore (midpoint between beginning and ending balance of ₹74,722 crore and ₹95,475 crore), we get:  54.0% (₹45,908 crore / ₹85,000 crore). Note: this is a rough estimate.
* **ROA (Return on Assets) (Inferred):**  Requires average total assets for the year, which is also not provided directly.  Similarly using a midpoint estimate of ₹138,000 crore, we get 33.3% (₹46,099 crore/₹138,000 crore). This is also a rough estimate.


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹202,359 crore
* **Gross Profit (Inferred):** ₹55,307 crore (This is calculated by subtracting the inferred cost of services from Revenue)
* **Gross Margin (Inferred):** 27.3% (₹55,307 crore / ₹202,359 crore)
* **Operating Margin:** This is not directly provided in the standalone statements and needs calculation. Assuming operating income as ₹55,307 crore (as inferred earlier), the operating margin is approximately 27.3% (₹55,307 crore / ₹202,359 crore).
* **Net Profit Margin (Inferred):** 21.5% (₹43,559 crore / ₹202,359 crore)
* **ROE (Return on Equity) (Inferred):** Using a rough average shareholder's equity of ₹78,000 crore (midpoint between beginning and ending balance from the statement of changes in equity), we get:  55.8% (₹43,559 crore / ₹78,000 crore). Note: this is a rough estimate.
* **ROA (Return on Assets) (Inferred):** Using a midpoint estimate of ₹107,000 crore for average total assets, we get: 40.8% (₹43,559 crore/₹107,000 crore).  This is a rough estimate.



**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded.
* The calculations for gross profit, gross margin, net profit margin, ROE, and ROA are *approximations* due to the absence of certain line items and the need to infer values from the provided text.
* The standalone figures represent only TCS Limited, whereas consolidated figures include all subsidiaries.  The differences between standalone and consolidated ratios highlight the impact of subsidiaries.
* For precise values, it is imperative to refer to the official, certified financial statements within the complete annual report.


### Liquidity Ratios
The annual report provides both consolidated and standalone financial statements.  We can approximate the liquidity ratios, but precise calculation requires the exact figures from the certified statements.  Also, the calculation of the quick ratio requires a precise identification of current assets which are readily convertible into cash and current liabilities.  The annual report does not provide a granular breakdown of such data.  Therefore, the values here are *approximations* based on the summarized data provided in the transcription:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Current Ratio (Inferred):**  Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities.

    * **Current Assets:** ₹46,104 crore
    * **Current Liabilities:** ₹46,104 crore
    * **Current Ratio (Inferred):** 1.0 (₹46,104 crore / ₹46,104 crore).  This is unusual and should be verified directly with the financial statements.

* **Quick Ratio (Inferred):**  This cannot be accurately calculated without a more detailed breakdown of current assets (excluding inventories and prepaid expenses) from the original report.
* **Cash Ratio (Inferred):** Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities.

    * **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹9,016 crore
    * **Current Liabilities:** ₹46,104 crore
    * **Cash Ratio (Inferred):** 0.2 (₹9,016 crore / ₹46,104 crore)


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Current Ratio (Inferred):**

    * **Current Assets:** ₹94,918 crore
    * **Current Liabilities:** ₹43,061 crore
    * **Current Ratio (Inferred):** 2.2 (₹94,918 crore / ₹43,061 crore)

* **Quick Ratio (Inferred):**  Cannot be accurately calculated without further detail on current assets.
* **Cash Ratio (Inferred):**

    * **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹3,644 crore
    * **Current Liabilities:** ₹43,061 crore
    * **Cash Ratio (Inferred):** 0.08 (₹3,644 crore / ₹43,061 crore)



**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.
* The calculations for the current and cash ratios are *approximations*.  The quick ratio cannot be computed accurately due to insufficient data in the transcription.
* Standalone figures pertain only to TCS Limited, while consolidated values include all subsidiaries.

To obtain precise liquidity ratio values, consult the original, certified financial statements in the annual report.  The discrepancies between the standalone and consolidated figures are due to the inclusion of subsidiary companies' financials in the consolidated statements.  The unusual current ratio of 1.0 in the consolidated statements should be investigated, as a healthy current ratio is typically higher than 1.



### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating precise efficiency ratios requires the exact figures from the certified financial statements and a precise understanding of the accounting methods used. The report provides some data, but a complete calculation requires more details than are available in the transcription.  Here's what we can approximate, keeping in mind these are *inferred calculations* based on the available data and certain assumptions:


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹240,893 crore
* **Average Total Assets:** This is not explicitly given. We'll estimate this by averaging the beginning and ending balances of total assets from the consolidated balance sheet.  Assume an average of approximately ₹138,000 crore.

    * **Asset Turnover (Inferred):** Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets.   Therefore: 1.74 (₹240,893 crore / ₹138,000 crore)

* **Average Inventory:**  Average inventory requires the beginning and ending inventory figures. Assume an average of approximately ₹28 crore.

    * **Inventory Turnover (Inferred):** Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  We need the cost of goods sold (COGS), which is not explicitly stated and requires inferring from various cost components in the financial statements.  This calculation is not reliable based on this text alone.

* **Average Accounts Receivable:**  Needs the beginning and ending receivables.  Using an approximation of ₹50,000 crore average accounts receivable (billed and unbilled combined), we get:

    * **Receivables Turnover (Inferred):** Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable.  Therefore: 4.82 (₹240,893 crore / ₹50,000 crore)



**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹202,359 crore
* **Average Total Assets:**  Again, this needs to be calculated. Let's assume an average of ₹107,000 crore using a midpoint estimate of beginning and ending assets from the standalone balance sheet.

    * **Asset Turnover (Inferred):** 1.9 (₹202,359 crore / ₹107,000 crore)

* **Average Inventory:** Assume an average of ₹27 crore.
    * **Inventory Turnover (Inferred):** This again requires the cost of goods sold, which cannot be reliably inferred from the provided data.


* **Average Accounts Receivable:** Using an approximate average of ₹43,000 crore, we obtain:

    * **Receivables Turnover (Inferred):**  4.7 (₹202,359 crore / ₹43,000 crore)



**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded.
* The calculations for asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover are *rough approximations* due to missing or summarized data in the text transcription.
* The standalone data represents only TCS Limited, whereas the consolidated data includes all subsidiaries.
* For accurate results, direct consultation of the original standalone and consolidated financial statements within the annual report is strongly advised.  The chosen average asset values are estimations and could significantly affect the asset turnover calculation.  Similarly, accurate inventory turnover requires a precise cost of goods sold figure, which is not readily available from the transcription.



### Leverage Ratios
Similar to other ratios, calculating precise use ratios requires the exact figures from the certified financial statements, and a detailed understanding of how the company accounts for its liabilities. The transcription only provides summarized data.  Therefore, the following are *approximations* based on the available information and certain assumptions:


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Debt to Equity Ratio (Inferred):** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity. The report does not clearly separate "Total Debt" as a single line item, therefore, this needs to be estimated by adding up various financial liabilities (short term and long term):


    * **Total Debt (Inferred):** ₹28,821 crore (this approximates total financial liabilities from the consolidated balance sheet).
    * **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹90,127 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Debt to Equity Ratio (Inferred):** 0.32 (₹28,821 crore / ₹90,127 crore)

* **Debt to Assets Ratio (Inferred):** Debt to Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets.


    * **Total Debt (Inferred):** ₹28,821 crore
    * **Total Assets:** ₹146,449 crore
    * **Debt to Assets Ratio (Inferred):** 0.20 (₹28,821 crore / ₹146,449 crore)

* **Interest Coverage Ratio (Inferred):** Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.


    * **EBIT:** ₹59,311 crore
    * **Interest Expense:** ₹778 crore
    * **Interest Coverage Ratio (Inferred):** 76.2 (₹59,311 crore / ₹778 crore)


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Debt to Equity Ratio (Inferred):**


    * **Total Debt (Inferred):** ₹29,262 crore (This approximates total financial liabilities from the standalone balance sheet).
    * **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹72,120 crore (as of March 31, 2024)
    * **Debt to Equity Ratio (Inferred):** 0.41 (₹29,262 crore / ₹72,120 crore)

* **Debt to Assets Ratio (Inferred):**


    * **Total Debt (Inferred):** ₹29,262 crore
    * **Total Assets:** ₹121,148 crore
    * **Debt to Assets Ratio (Inferred):** 0.24 (₹29,262 crore / ₹121,148 crore)

* **Interest Coverage Ratio (Inferred):**


    * **EBIT (from Standalone Profit & Loss):** ₹58,560 crore
    * **Interest Expense:** ₹673 crore
    * **Interest Coverage Ratio (Inferred):** 87.0 (₹58,560 crore / ₹673 crore)



**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded to the nearest crore.
* The calculations for these ratios are *approximations*.  The precise values depend on how exactly the company classifies certain items on its balance sheet, and requires specific values not fully available from the text transcription. For example, the calculation of total debt is based on a summation of various financial liabilities (short and long term) present in the Balance sheet.
* The standalone figures are only for TCS Limited, while the consolidated figures include all subsidiaries.  Therefore, the differences in use ratios between standalone and consolidated reflect the financial structure of subsidiaries.
* To obtain completely accurate use ratios, direct consultation of the original standalone and consolidated financial statements and related notes in the complete annual report is necessary.  The "Debt" values are inferred and could have slight differences with the exact values in the financial statements.






## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The annual report provides some of this information, but others require calculations and assumptions.  Also, market-based ratios like the PE and PB ratios will vary depending on the share price at the time of the calculation. The values given below are based on data available in the report and therefore are approximations:

**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Market Capitalization:** Not explicitly given.  This would require knowing the closing share price on the relevant date (March 31, 2024) and the number of outstanding shares.  Market cap is also often calculated using the average closing price over a given period (e.g. the last trading day).

* **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):** Not explicitly given.  The calculation requires the market capitalization and earnings per share (EPS).  The report provides the EPS (₹125.88).  Using the 10-year trend of the P/E ratio, and assuming it stayed consistent for FY24 and using a closing market cap of ₹14,000,000 crore (a rough approximation based on the provided market cap data in the report for the period), we arrive at an estimated P/E ratio of 30.8 for the year ended March 31, 2024.

* **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):** Not explicitly given. Calculation requires market capitalization and book value of equity.  The report gives the book value of equity.  Using the same approximate market cap of ₹14,000,000 crore and approximating the book value of equity to ₹85,000 crore (midpoint between opening and closing), we obtain a P/B ratio of approximately 165.


* **Dividend Yield:** Not explicitly given.  The calculation requires annual dividend per share and the share price at the end of the year.  Using the total dividend of ₹73 and an approximated closing price of ₹3900, we arrive at a dividend yield of approximately 1.87%.

* **Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):** Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends Paid / Net Income.

    * **Dividends Paid:** ₹26,486 crore (this accounts for both interim and final dividends)
    * **Net Income:** ₹45,908 crore
    * **Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):** 57.7% (₹26,486 crore / ₹45,908 crore)


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Market Capitalization:** As mentioned before, this is not directly provided and is a key value needed for calculating other market metrics.  Using the same approximate market cap of ₹14,000,000 crore, this can be considered.

* **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):** This needs to be calculated from market cap and EPS. Using the given EPS of ₹119.44, we can estimate the standalone P/E ratio as approximately 29.3, based on the same approximated market cap used above.


* **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio):**  This requires market capitalization and book value. Using the same estimated market cap and an approximated book value of ₹78,000 crore (midpoint of opening and closing from Statement of Changes in Equity), we obtain a P/B ratio of approximately 180.


* **Dividend Yield:** Using the total dividend of ₹73 and an approximate closing price of ₹3900, we arrive at a dividend yield of approximately 1.87%.


* **Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):**

    * **Dividends Paid:** ₹26,486 crore
    * **Net Income:** ₹43,559 crore
    * **Dividend Payout Ratio (Inferred):** 60.8% (₹26,486 crore / ₹43,559 crore)


**Important Notes:**

* All values are in Indian Rupees (₹) and rounded.  Market capitalization, P/E ratio, and P/B ratio are estimations.
* Standalone values represent TCS Limited, while consolidated values include all subsidiaries.  Significant differences highlight the impact of subsidiaries.
* Consult the original annual report for precise figures, especially the closing share price on the relevant date, as market-based ratios will change with share price fluctuations. The market cap and other market based values could be quite different depending on when the numbers are calculated.  Therefore, these estimates should be treated as ballpark numbers only.

**Important Notes:**

* All revenue figures are for the year ended March 31, 2024.
* Market share data is not explicitly provided in the report for each segment.  The report does mention TCS' overall market share (2.1%) in the IT services industry, but a more granular breakdown by segment is not available.
* "Key Products/Services" is a summarized representation; TCS offers a wide range of services within each segment.
* Geographic presence is generally global, but the specifics might vary for different offerings and segments.


To obtain more detailed segment-specific information, including precise market share data, you should refer directly to the original annual report. The provided transcription contains a summary of the segmental data and not all the detail has been included.  The market shares mentioned here are also thus based on the available information and could thus differ from the certified figures reported by the company.





## Risk Management
### Risk Assessment
The annual report's Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section details key risk factors.  Categorizing them precisely and assigning specific likelihood and severity scores requires judgment and more detailed information than provided in the transcription.  However, we can summarize the key risks based on the provided text:


**I. Key Risk Factors & Analysis:**

The following table summarizes key risk factors identified in the report.  The "Severity" and "Likelihood" are subjective assessments based on the report's descriptions and are not precise quantifications:
