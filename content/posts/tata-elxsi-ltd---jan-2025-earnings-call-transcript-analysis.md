    *   Reduced COGS (product-related) & Depreciation/Finance cost: ~45 bps positive impact.
    *   Q2 margins were aided by "onetime R&D incentives and tax credits from previous years."

### Guidance & Forecasts

*   Tax Rate: Q3 at 22.2% (due to deferred tax asset differences, forex profit treatment). YTD at 24.1%. Expected to normalize upwards of 25% (potentially 26%) in Q4. Full year FY25 ETR projected between 24.5% to 25%. Long-term tax rate expected >25%.

*   Decline/Slowdown Areas: Automotive market, particularly in Europe and US, impacting new deal closures and Tier 1 supplier spend. System Integration business impacted by "decision delays in some large projects." Tier 1 segment within Auto continues to be a challenge.

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

*   Ramp-up of the new US operator deal expected over the next few quarters.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends

*   Significant challenges in the Automotive industry (US/Europe OEMs facing sales/growth issues).
*   Automotive Tier 1 supplier spend impacted negatively. Trend is OEMs insourcing or directly engaging with ER&D providers.
*   Some OEMs reconsidering near-term EV R&D budgets, refocusing on ICE/Hybrids due to market conditions and competition. "Long-term EV strategy continues."
*   Strong interest persists in Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV) and ADAS across passenger and commercial vehicles.
*   Rapid growth of Chinese EV OEMs impacting Western OEM market share, particularly in China, leading to budget pressures and strategic rethinking for Western players. "market share of the Western OEMs in China is coming down."
*   Potential for Western governments to use tariffs/non-tariff barriers against Chinese EVs.
*   Stabilization and "green shoots" observed in Media & Communication and Healthcare verticals after previous slowdowns.

### Competitive Positioning

*   Positioned well with AVENIR SDV suite, offering a "ready to adopt solution, coupled with deep digital and software expertise."
*   Strong positioning in Japan market highlighted by Suzuki ODC win.
*   India-based companies seen as having an advantage as Western OEMs are "wary of using Chinese software."
*   Company fundamentals remain strong: "design, digital capabilities," customer satisfaction (4.75/5).

### Market Challenges/Opportunities

*   Challenge: Navigating automotive slowdown in Europe/US, currency volatility, geopolitical uncertainty. Tier 1 weakness. Direct entry into China market is difficult.
*   Opportunity: Growth in Japan, India, Emerging Markets. SDV and ADAS demand. Leveraging relationships with Western OEMs potentially collaborating with Chinese players. Growth in adjacencies (Commercial Vehicles, Aero/Defence). Capturing spend shifting from Tier 1s to OEMs/ER&D providers. Media & Comm and Healthcare recovery.

### Market Share/Positioning

*   Increasing share of business directly with OEMs in Automotive (72% vs 67% prior).
*   Established strong position in Japan.
*   JLR remains a significant customer, but dependence has reduced over time.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Acknowledged Concerns

*   Automotive market slowdown in US & Europe impacting deal closures and ramp-up pace. "This has impacted new deal closures and the Tier 1 supplier spend."
*   European auto market recovery may take "a quarter or a couple of quarters."
*   Tier 1 supplier business continues to decline. "Tier 1 continues to be a source of a challenge for us."
*   Impact of Chinese EV competition on Western OEM clients' budgets and strategies.
*   Decision delays impacting the System Integration business.
*   Near-term margin pressure due to wage hikes, currency volatility (GBP, EUR, JPY cited), and slower growth impacting operating leverage.

### Regulatory Issues

*   None explicitly mentioned impacting Tata Elxsi directly, but potential government actions (tariffs/subsidies) related to EVs in the West were discussed as a market factor.

### Operational Constraints

*   Need for third-party contractors for specific skill sets mentioned as a minor cost factor, aiming to replace with internal workforce over time.

### Market Uncertainties

*   Geopolitical uncertainty, currency volatility, pace of automotive market recovery (especially Europe), client budget reprioritization in Auto (EV vs ICE/Hybrid).

## Forward-Looking Statements

### Outlook & Projections

*   Expect continued ramp-up of large auto deals in Q4, albeit potentially slower than initially planned for some.
*   Anticipate acceleration in APAC/India auto business; US auto expected to be steady; Europe auto to remain slow near-term.
*   Expect Media & Communication and Healthcare verticals to return to growth, potentially starting next quarter or Q1 FY26. "could take one quarter or maybe a couple of quarters to really get back."
*   FY25 overall growth expected to be soft. "it will be very difficult for us to pull so much in Q4 to compensate for the flatness that we are seeing."
*   Tax rate expected to be >25% going forward.
