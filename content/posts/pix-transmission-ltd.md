## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis examines PIX Transmissions Limited's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

The report highlights strong financial results for FY2024, exceeding consolidated annual revenues of ₹511 crore (approximately $62 million USD based on an average exchange rate of ₹82 per USD for FY2024) and achieving a record Profit Before Tax (PBT) exceeding ₹110 crore (approximately $13.4 million USD).  However, the standalone financial statements provide more detailed figures:

* **Standalone Revenue:** ₹454.79 crore (approximately $55.4 million USD) - a slight increase compared to the previous year's ₹450.14 crore.
* **Standalone PBT:** ₹1044.24 crore (approximately $12.7 million USD) - a significant improvement over the previous year's ₹740.46 crore.
* **Standalone Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹792.10 crore (approximately $9.6 million USD) -  a substantial increase from ₹553.92 crore in FY2023.
* **Dividend Recommendation:** ₹7.00 per equity share (FY2023: ₹6.00).

**Key Financial Ratios (Standalone):**  Precise calculations require the full financial statements, but some key ratios can be approximated from the provided data:

* **Gross Profit Margin:**  Cannot be precisely calculated without Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) details, but appears healthy based on the significant increase in PBT.
* **Operating Profit Margin:**  Improved significantly in FY2024 compared to FY2023, indicating improved operational efficiency.
* **Net Profit Margin:**  Substantially improved in FY2024, signifying better profitability.
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**  Decreased from 0.19 in FY2023 to 0.10 in FY2024, demonstrating improved financial health.
* **Current Ratio:** Improved from 3.58 in FY2023 to 4.98 in FY2024. This indicates a stronger liquidity position.

**II. Business Segments:**

PIX Transmissions primarily operates in the manufacturing and trading of power transmission belts.  The report breaks down the revenue contribution as follows:

* **V-Belts Manufacturing:** 98% of turnover. This is the core business and the primary driver of revenue.
* **Trading of Powerware Products:** 2% of turnover.  This segment is a smaller contributor to overall revenue.

The Company serves both domestic and international markets, with exports contributing over 50% of total turnover.  The report mentions subsidiaries in the UAE, UK, and Germany, expanding the reach into Middle Eastern and European markets.

**III. Risks:**

The report identifies many key risk factors impacting the business:

* **Geopolitical Tensions:** Global instability and conflicts (specifically mentioned conflicts in the Red Sea) affect freight rates and container availability, potentially disrupting supply chains.
* **High Borrowing Costs:** Increased interest rates in key export markets (Western Europe and North America) have led to demand normalization in these regions.
* **Cooling of Pent-Up Demand:**  Post-pandemic demand normalization is impacting sales, necessitating a shift towards the domestic market.
* **Commodity Price Risk and Foreign Exchange Risk:**  The report mentions foreign exchange risk,  primarily due to foreign currency borrowings, trade receivables, and payables.  They employ hedging strategies (forward contracts) to mitigate this risk.

**IV. ESG Initiatives:**

The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) details PIX Transmissions' ESG initiatives:

* **Environmental:** The company focuses on energy conservation (electricity, fuel, and water), waste management (plastic, E-waste, hazardous, and other waste), and compliance with environmental regulations (EPR norms). They've implemented a sewage treatment plant and an effluent treatment plant to reduce water consumption and environmental impact.  However, significant opportunities exist for further improvement in their environmental performance, as highlighted by their ongoing pursuit of LCA and  greener technologies.
* **Social:** The company emphasizes employee well-being, providing health insurance and other benefits. They mention efforts in skill development and have undertaken CSR initiatives focusing on education (blind children, underprivileged children) and healthcare for underprivileged communities.  The company has a low turnover rate, indicating a positive employee retention environment. However, there's limited disclosure regarding aspects such as diversity and inclusion in leadership roles.
* **Governance:**  The report extensively covers corporate governance practices, including Board composition, committee structures (Audit, Nomination & Remuneration, Stakeholder Relationship, CSR & Governance, Risk Management), code of conduct, whistleblower policy, and investor grievance redressal mechanisms.  The company emphasizes transparency and compliance with regulations.  However, further improvements could be made by disclosing the diversity composition of their employees and implementing a robust, detailed diversity and inclusion policy.

**V. Overall Assessment:**

PIX Transmissions Limited demonstrates strong financial performance in FY2024, driven by its core V-belt manufacturing business and a successful pivot towards the domestic market.  While the company shows positive trends in ESG, there's considerable room for enhancement in their environmental performance and broader social responsibility. The detailed disclosure on corporate governance is a strong point.  Future reports should include more quantitative data on ESG targets and progress.  The limited detailed explanation around the significant increase in profit margins compared to the previous year should also be further clarified.

**Important Note:**  These are approximate USD conversions using a single average exchange rate.  The actual USD values might slightly differ depending on the specific exchange rates used for each transaction during the fiscal year.  Consult the report's financial statements and utilize the reported exchange rates for precise USD conversions.

### Equity Analysis
Here's a breakdown of the shareholders' equity, retained earnings, and share capital values for PIX Transmissions Limited, as of March 31, 2024, in Indian Rupees (INR) in lacs (1 lac = 100,000).  USD equivalents are approximate, using an average exchange rate of ₹82 per USD for the fiscal year.  Remember this is an approximation; the actual USD value may vary depending on the specific exchange rate used.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹4,597,660,000 (approximately $56 million USD)
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹4,141,956,000 (approximately $50.5 million USD)

* **Retained Earnings:** ₹4,453,676,000 (approximately $54.3 million USD)
* **Share Capital:** ₹136,241,000 (approximately $1.7 million USD)


**Important Note:**  These USD values are approximations.  The actual USD equivalent might be slightly different depending on the precise exchange rate used for each transaction during the fiscal year. The financial statements in the annual report should be consulted for the accurate INR amounts and any reported exchange rates for more precise USD conversions.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
The income statement data for PIX Transmissions Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, is presented in Indian Rupees (INR) in lacs (1 lac = 100,000).  I will provide approximate USD equivalents using an average exchange rate of ₹82 per USD for the fiscal year.  Remember that these are approximations, and the actual USD values may vary depending on the specific exchange rate used.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹4,547,886,000 (approximately $55.4 million USD)
* **Cost of Revenue:**  ₹3,691,142,000 (approximately $45 million USD)  *(This is a calculation combining Cost of Materials Consumed, Purchases of Stock-in-Trade, and Changes in Inventories.)*
* **Gross Profit:** ₹856,744,000 (approximately $10.4 million USD)  *(Revenue - Cost of Revenue)*
* **Operating Expenses:**  Cannot be directly calculated from the provided excerpts. The report shows various expense categories (employee benefits, finance costs, depreciation, other expenses) totaling ₹3,691,142,000. However,  some of these, like finance costs, are not strictly operating expenses.  To obtain a true operating expense figure, you need the complete standalone statement of profit and loss.
* **Operating Income:** ₹1,044,235,000 - 476,630,000 = ₹567,605,000 (approximately $6.9 million USD)  *(This is an *approximation*.  It takes Profit Before Tax (PBT) and subtracts finance costs.  To get the true operating income, you need to isolate operating expenses from other non-operating expenses in the full income statement.)*


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Revenue:** ₹4,930,647,000 (approximately $60.1 million USD)
* **Cost of Revenue:** ₹4,010,525,000 (approximately $48.9 million USD)  *(This is a calculation combining Cost of Materials Consumed, Purchases of Stock-in-Trade, and Changes in Inventories.)*
* **Gross Profit:** ₹920,122,000 (approximately $11.2 million USD) *(Revenue - Cost of Revenue)*
* **Operating Expenses:** Cannot be directly calculated from the provided excerpts.  Similar to the standalone statements, the full consolidated income statement is needed to determine the precise operating expense figure.
* **Operating Income:** ₹11,070,510,000 - ₹476,630,000 = ₹10,593,880,000 (approximately $129 million USD)   *(This is an *approximation*.  It takes Profit Before Tax (PBT) and subtracts finance costs. A precise operating income requires isolating operating expenses in the complete consolidated income statement.)*

**Important Note:** These USD figures are approximations based on a single average exchange rate.  For precise figures and a complete picture of operating income and expenses, you must refer to the complete standalone and consolidated statements of profit and loss included in the annual report.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Here's a summary of the net income, EBITDA, basic EPS, and diluted EPS values for PIX Transmissions Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.  Values are in Indian Rupees (INR) in lacs (1 lac = 100,000), with approximate USD equivalents using an average exchange rate of ₹82 per USD for FY2024. Remember these USD conversions are approximations; the actual USD values may vary based on the precise exchange rate used for each transaction.

**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income:** ₹792,103,000 (approximately $9.6 million USD)
* **EBITDA:**  Cannot be precisely calculated from the provided excerpts.  The complete standalone statement of profit and loss is needed to determine EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) by adding back depreciation and amortization and interest expense to the profit before tax figure.
* **Basic EPS:** ₹58.14 (approximately $0.71 USD)
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹58.14 (approximately $0.71 USD)


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Net Income:** ₹8,298,770,000 (approximately $101 million USD)
* **EBITDA:** Cannot be precisely calculated from the provided excerpts.  You need the complete consolidated statement of profit and loss to calculate EBITDA (by adding back depreciation and amortization, and interest expense to the profit before tax).
* **Basic EPS:** ₹60.91 (approximately $0.74 USD)
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹60.91 (approximately $0.74 USD)

**Important Note:**  These USD values are approximations based on an average exchange rate. To obtain precise figures, consult the complete standalone and consolidated statements of profit and loss from the annual report, and utilize the exchange rates they provide for accurate USD conversions.  Also, remember that EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and its calculation needs specific line items from the income statement.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
The cash flow statement data for PIX Transmissions Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, is presented in Indian Rupees (INR) in lacs (1 lac = 100,000).  I'll provide approximate USD equivalents using an average exchange rate of ₹82 per USD for the fiscal year.  Remember that these are approximations, and the actual USD values may vary depending on the specific exchange rate used.

**Standalone Cash Flow Statement:**

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹1,330,355,000 (approximately $16.2 million USD)
* **Investing Cash Flow:** ₹(853,083,000) (approximately -$10.4 million USD)  *Note the negative sign indicating net cash outflow.*
* **Financing Cash Flow:** ₹(4,586,350,000) (approximately -$55.9 million USD) *Note the negative sign indicating net cash outflow.*


**Consolidated Cash Flow Statement:**

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹1,368,581,000 (approximately $16.7 million USD)
* **Investing Cash Flow:** ₹(8,785,210,000) (approximately -$107 million USD) *Note the negative sign indicating net cash outflow.*
* **Financing Cash Flow:** ₹(4,586,340,000) (approximately -$55.9 million USD) *Note the negative sign indicating net cash outflow.*

**Important Note:** These USD values are approximations based on an average exchange rate. For precise figures, consult the complete standalone and consolidated statements of cash flow from the annual report and use the reported exchange rates provided therein for accurate USD conversions. The negative values for investing and financing cash flows highlight significant capital expenditures and financing activities during the year.

### Cash Flow Metrics
Calculating free cash flow (FCF), capital expenditure (CAPEX), and dividends paid requires information from multiple sections of the financial statements.  Unfortunately, the provided excerpts don't give all the necessary data for a completely precise calculation of FCF.  We can make approximations, but these will be subject to the limitations of the data provided.  All values are in INR in lacs (1 lac = 100,000).  USD equivalents are approximate using an average exchange rate of ₹82 per USD for FY2024.


**Standalone Financial Statements:**

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  This isn't directly stated but can be approximated from the investing cash flows. The purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), including capital advances and work-in-progress, totaled ₹2,022.04 lac + ₹459.49 lac = ₹2,481.53 lac (approximately $30.3 million USD).  This represents a significant CAPEX for the year.

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹815.56 lac (approximately $9.9 million USD)

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  A precise calculation requires Operating Cash Flow minus CAPEX and changes in working capital. While we have a figure for operating cash flow (₹1,330.35 lac), a complete picture of changes in working capital is missing from the provided excerpts.  Therefore, a precise FCF cannot be calculated.  A *rough* estimate would subtract the CAPEX from the operating cash flow, resulting in a positive FCF but an inaccurate one.


**Consolidated Financial Statements:**

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** Similar to the standalone figures, we can approximate CAPEX from the investing cash flows.  The purchase of PP&E (including capital advances and work-in-progress) was ₹2,191.06 lac + ₹459.49 lac = ₹2,650.55 lac (approximately $32.3 million USD).

* **Dividends Paid:** ₹815.57 lac (approximately $9.9 million USD)

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  As with the standalone statements, a precise FCF calculation requires the complete statement of cash flows to account for changes in working capital.  Thus, an exact calculation is not possible with the provided information.  A *rough* estimate (operating cash flow - CAPEX) would result in a positive FCF but would be inaccurate.


**Important Note:**  These USD values are approximations based on an average exchange rate. For a precise calculation of FCF, one needs the complete statement of cash flows and a full breakdown of changes in working capital from the annual report. The provided excerpts only offer partial information, so the FCF values above are rough estimates.  Use the actual exchange rates reported in the financial statements for more accurate USD conversions.

### Profitability Ratios
Calculating profitability ratios requires many key figures from the income statement and balance sheet. The provided excerpts don't contain all necessary data for precise calculations.  We can offer estimations, but these will be subject to the limitations of the available information.  All values will be expressed as percentages.


**Standalone Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Gross Profit Margin:** This requires the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), which is not explicitly stated but can be approximated from the cost of materials consumed, purchases of stock-in-trade, and changes in inventories (₹3,691.14 lac).  Therefore,  Gross Profit Margin ≈ (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)/Revenue ≈ (4547.89 - 3691.14)/4547.89 ≈ 18.8%.

* **Operating Margin:**  This needs the Operating Income, which we cannot accurately calculate from the provided extracts (see previous analysis). An *approximation* can be made by subtracting only finance costs from PBT: (1044.24 - 476.63)/4547.89 ≈ 12.4%.  However, this is only a rough estimate.

* **Net Profit Margin:** Net Profit Margin ≈ Net Income/Revenue ≈ 792.10/4547.89 ≈ 17.4%.

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** ROE ≈ Net Income/Average Shareholder's Equity.  The annual report provides the shareholder's equity at the beginning and end of the year.  To approximate the average, we'll add them and divide by 2: Average Shareholder's Equity ≈ (3889.39 + 4597.66)/2 ≈ 4243.52.   Therefore, ROE ≈ 792.10/4243.52 ≈ 18.6%.

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** ROA ≈ Net Income/Average Total Assets.  Similarly, we'll approximate the average total assets: Average Total Assets ≈ (5432.16 + 5993.73)/2 ≈ 5712.95. Therefore, ROA ≈ 792.10/5712.95 ≈ 13.9%.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Gross Profit Margin:** Similar to the standalone calculation, we'll approximate COGS. Consolidated Gross Profit Margin ≈ (Revenue - Cost of Revenue)/Revenue ≈ (4930.65 - 4010.52)/4930.65 ≈ 18.6%.

* **Operating Margin:**  An *approximation* using PBT minus finance costs: (11070.51 - 476.63)/4930.65 ≈ 21.3%.  This is only a rough estimate; the true operating margin requires a complete breakdown of operating expenses.

* **Net Profit Margin:** Net Profit Margin ≈ Net Income/Revenue ≈ 8298.77/4930.65 ≈ 16.8%.

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** Average Shareholder's Equity ≈ (41799.34 + 49269.32)/2 ≈ 45534.33.  Therefore, ROE ≈ 8298.77/45534.33 ≈ 18.2%.

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** Average Total Assets ≈ (57851.05 + 63686.18)/2 ≈ 60768.62. Therefore, ROA ≈ 8298.77/60768.62 ≈ 13.7%.


**Important Note:**  These are *rough estimates* due to the limited data available in the provided excerpts.  For precise calculations of these ratios, you must consult the complete standalone and consolidated income statements and balance sheets from the annual report.  Using the data within the full statements will produce more accurate results.  Also remember that the calculation of operating margin is critically dependent on the correct identification of operating expenses from non-operating ones.


### Liquidity Ratios
Calculating liquidity ratios requires data from the balance sheet.  Here are the approximations for PIX Transmissions Limited's liquidity ratios as of March 31, 2024, using the data provided earlier. Remember that these calculations are based on the partial data from the annual report and will not be precise.  All ratios will be expressed as a decimal.

**Standalone Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Current Ratio:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities ≈ 3164.63/6630.31 ≈ 0.48

* **Quick Ratio:** Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities ≈ (3164.63 - 841.197)/6630.31 ≈ 0.35

* **Cash Ratio:** Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities ≈ 334.492/6630.31 ≈ 0.05


**Consolidated Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Current Ratio:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities ≈ 3531.75/7086.49 ≈ 0.50

* **Quick Ratio:** Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities ≈ (3531.75 - 979.39)/7086.49 ≈ 0.36

* **Cash Ratio:** Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities ≈ 485.273/7086.49 ≈ 0.07


**Important Note:** These are approximations due to the incomplete data in the excerpts.  For precise calculations, consult the full standalone and consolidated balance sheets within the annual report.  These will provide the most accurate data for calculating the liquidity ratios.  Using data from the complete financial statements will produce more accurate and reliable results.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating efficiency ratios requires data from both the income statement and the balance sheet.  Because we only have partial data from the annual report, the calculations below are approximations, and the results should be considered estimates.  All ratios will be expressed as a decimal.


**Standalone Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Asset Turnover:** Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets.  Approximating average total assets as (5432.16 + 5993.73)/2 ≈ 5712.95.  Therefore, Asset Turnover ≈ 4547.89/5712.95 ≈ 0.796

* **Inventory Turnover:** Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory.  We approximated COGS previously as ₹3,691.14 lac.  Approximating average inventory as (8503.11 + 8411.97)/2 ≈ 8457.54. Therefore, Inventory Turnover ≈ 3691.14/8457.54 ≈ 0.436

* **Receivables Turnover:** Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable.  Approximating average accounts receivable as (10493.65 + 10381.00)/2 ≈ 10437.32.  Therefore, Receivables Turnover ≈ 4547.89/10437.32 ≈ 0.436


**Consolidated Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Asset Turnover:** Approximating average total assets as (57851.05 + 63686.18)/2 ≈ 60768.62.  Therefore, Asset Turnover ≈ 4930.65/60768.62 ≈ 0.081

* **Inventory Turnover:** Approximating average inventory as (10545.14 + 9793.85)/2 ≈ 10169.50. Therefore, Inventory Turnover ≈ 4010.52/10169.50 ≈ 0.394

* **Receivables Turnover:** Approximating average accounts receivable as (10544.30 + 11003.52)/2 ≈ 10773.91.  Therefore, Receivables Turnover ≈ 4930.65/10773.91 ≈ 0.457


**Important Note:** These are *rough estimates*.  For accurate calculations, consult the complete standalone and consolidated income statements and balance sheets within the annual report.  These will provide the necessary figures for more precise and reliable results. The approximations here are subject to the limitations of the data provided and the estimations made for COGS and average asset/inventory values.  Using the full financial data will greatly improve the accuracy of these calculations.



### Leverage Ratios
Leverage ratios assess a company's financial risk by examining the proportion of debt in its capital structure.  Here are the approximations for PIX Transmissions Limited's use ratios as of March 31, 2024, based on the data previously extracted from the annual report. Keep in mind that these calculations are based on limited information and should be viewed as estimates.  All ratios are expressed as decimals.


**Standalone Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity.  Approximating total debt as the sum of long-term and short-term debt (7330.38 + 1144.71 = 8475.09) and using the previously calculated average shareholder's equity of 4243.52,  Debt-to-Equity Ratio ≈ 8475.09/4243.52 ≈ 1.998

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Debt-to-Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets. Using the approximated average total assets of 5712.95, Debt-to-Assets Ratio ≈ 8475.09/5712.95 ≈ 1.483

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  The interest expense is provided (476.63 lac), but EBIT needs to be calculated from the full income statement as it is not directly available. This makes a precise calculation of interest coverage impossible with the limited data.


**Consolidated Financial Statements (Approximations):**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Approximating total debt as (7330.37 + 1144.71 = 8475.08) and using the approximated average shareholder's equity of 45534.33, Debt-to-Equity Ratio ≈ 8475.08/45534.33 ≈ 0.186

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Using the approximated average total assets of 60768.62, Debt-to-Assets Ratio ≈ 8475.08/60768.62 ≈ 0.139

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:**  Similar to the standalone case, a precise calculation is not possible without the complete income statement to determine EBIT. Therefore, an accurate interest coverage cannot be computed with the given limited data.


**Important Note:**  These are *approximations*. The precise values require the full standalone and consolidated balance sheets (for debt and equity figures) and the full income statement (for EBIT) from the annual report.  Using the complete financial data will generate far more accurate results for these use ratios.  The approximation of average values for assets and equity are also subject to error. The provided figures only give a very rough idea of the company's leverage.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
Calculating these market-related metrics requires information not fully available in the provided excerpts.  We can make estimations, but they will be imprecise.  All values will be expressed as decimals.


**Market Cap (Approximation):**

Market capitalization (market cap) is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the number of outstanding shares. The annual report provides the number of outstanding shares (136.25 lac), but the current share price is needed from a financial data source (such as a stock exchange website) *as of the date you are doing this calculation*.  Let's assume, for illustrative purposes only, a share price of ₹1,000.  Then:

* **Approximated Market Cap:** 136.25 lac shares * ₹1,000/share = ₹13,625,000,000 (approximately $166 million USD based on an average exchange rate).


**PE Ratio (Approximation):**

The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio compares the market price per share to the earnings per share (EPS).  We have the basic and diluted EPS (approximately ₹60.91 from the consolidated income statement). To calculate the PE ratio, you need the *current* market price per share from a financial data provider (not provided in the report). Again, let's assume a current market price of ₹1,000. Then:

* **Approximated PE Ratio:** ₹1,000 / ₹60.91 ≈ 16.4


**PB Ratio (Approximation):**

The Price-to-Book (PB) ratio compares the market price per share to the book value per share. Book value per share can be calculated using the total shareholder's equity and the number of outstanding shares.

* **Approximated Book Value per Share (Consolidated):**  4926.93 lac / 136.25 lac shares ≈ ₹361.45
* **Approximated PB Ratio (Consolidated):** ₹1,000 / ₹361.45 ≈ 2.8


**Dividend Yield (Approximation):**

Dividend yield is the annual dividend per share divided by the current market price per share. The annual dividend was ₹7.00 per share.  Using our assumed market price of ₹1,000:

* **Approximated Dividend Yield:** ₹7.00 / ₹1,000 ≈ 0.007


**Dividend Payout Ratio (Approximation):**

Dividend payout ratio is the percentage of net income paid out as dividends.

* **Approximated Dividend Payout Ratio (Consolidated):** (817.51 lac * 100) / 8298.77 lac ≈ 9.8%

**Important Note:** These figures are rough estimates only. The actual market cap, PE ratio, PB ratio, dividend yield, and dividend payout ratio will vary based on the *current* market price per share, which is not included in the annual report, and the actual values reported in the financial statements, which were incomplete in the provided data. To obtain accurate calculations, one must obtain the current market price per share from a financial data provider and use the complete, audited financial statements.  The accuracy of these estimations heavily relies on the assumed share price.
