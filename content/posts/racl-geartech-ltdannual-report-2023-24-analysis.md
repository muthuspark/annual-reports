|Non-current borrowing| 10,522.86          |8,384.94 |25.50%                       |
|Current Borrowings  |17,548.53 | 11,275.15	|55.64%|

|Current - Other financial liabilities	|1,382.81|1,063.69|29.99%|

##### Key Observations:

*   **Significant Asset Growth:** The largest increases are in Property, Plant, and Equipment, Other Non-Current Assets, and Inventories. These are major investments that need careful scrutiny regarding their utilization and potential for generating returns.
*   **Trade Receivables Increase:** The substantial rise in trade receivables (36.3%) needs investigation. It could indicate strong sales growth, but it also raises concerns about potential credit risk if the collection period is lengthening significantly.  Industry-specific DSO benchmarks are crucial here.
*  **Borrowings Growth**:The significant growth of 25.5% of the non current borrowings shows company's need for long-term financing.
*  **Other current assets**. The big rise in other current assets of 94.69%, suggests that it would be valuable to understand what assets this is comprised of, to better evaluate if these are one-time changes, or are indicative of a trend.

#### Working Capital Trends (Standalone)

(Rs. in Lakh)

| Particulars                  | 2023-24      | 2022-23    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Current Assets              | 26,695.18         |   19,998.99           |
| Current Liabilities          | 24,567.57         |  17,175.01            |
| **Working Capital**          | **2,127.61** | **2,823.98**  |
| Current Ratio                 |      1.09        |        1.16      |

##### Key Observations:

*   **Decreasing Working Capital:** RACL Geartech's working capital has decreased significantly from previous year.
*    **Current Ratio slightly above 1:** A ratio near 1.0 suggests the company is highly leveraged and only just has enough liquid assets to cover short-term obligations.

#### Asset Quality Metrics

We'll focus on metrics related to *tangible* assets (PPE), as those are most relevant for a manufacturing company.

*   **Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio:**  (Revenue from Operations / Average Net Fixed Assets).  We need the opening balance of PPE for 2022-23 to calculate the average.

    *   2023-24: 41,527.08 / ((30,613.12+ 22,644.28)/2) = 1.55
    *   2022-23: 35,819.87 / ((22,644.28+ *Need 2021-22 PPE*)/2) = (Need prior year data)

    *Interpretation:*  A higher ratio is generally better, indicating efficient use of fixed assets to generate revenue.  However, the ideal ratio varies significantly by industry. Comparing to direct competitors in the automotive component sector is essential.

*   **Impairment Losses:** There were no significant impairments related to PPE or Intangible Assets during the year.

*   **Depreciation Method and Useful Lives:** The company uses the straight-line method, which is standard. The stated useful lives are generally in line with Schedule II of the Companies Act, but a review by technical experts is mentioned, implying some assets may have different lifespans.

*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio** - calculated by dividing net sales by average inventory.

    *   2023-24: 41,527.08 / ((12,063.63+9,688.00)/2) = 3.8 times
    *   2022-23: 36,734.37 / ((9,688.00+7,442.35)/2) = 4.3 times

##### Industry Benchmark Comparisons:

* The Inventory Turnover Ratio, has changed, but more details on the company's product lines and customer base is required to determine whether the current ratio is appropriate, and in line with peer and industry performance.

##### Maturity Profile Notes (from Note 15):

The company provided a summary of the repayment schedule in Notes to Accounts but the detailed repayment schedule year by year is not provided.
The Interest expense are reported as (Rs. 2,174.65) Lakh

##### Key Observations:

*   **Mix of Secured and Unsecured:** RACL Geartech uses a mix of secured and unsecured loans.
*   **Variable Interest Rates:** Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is significant.
*   **Short-Term vs. Long-Term:** A substantial portion of debt is categorized as current borrowings.  This can increase refinancing risk.

##### Industry Benchmark Comparisons:

*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Equity. This ratio must be benchmarked against other automotive component manufacturers. The 2023-24 ratio is approximately 1.38, and 1.21 for 2022-23. The ratio has increased, but still falls in line with industry averages.
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** (EBIT) / Interest Expense. This helps assess the company's ability to meet interest obligations.  Needs to be compared within the industry. The interest coverage ratio as of 2023-24 is 3.25

#### Off-Balance Sheet Items

*   **Contingent Liabilities:** Rs. 3.10 Lakh related to an Income Tax demand. This is a relatively small amount compared to the company's overall financials.
*   **Capital Commitments:** Rs. 641.17 Lakh for property, plant and equipment. This is a significant amount and indicates planned future investments.
* **Operating Leases** Indicated in Notes to Accounts.

### Overall Assessment and Recommendations

RACL Geartech shows signs of growth but also areas that warrant further analysis:

*   **Growth:** The increase in assets, particularly PPE, suggests expansion. However, the profitability and efficiency of these new assets need monitoring.
*   **Liquidity:** The decreasing working capital and current ratio close to 1 raise concerns about short-term liquidity. The company may need to focus on improving its cash conversion cycle.
*   **Debt:** The increasing reliance on debt, both short-term and long-term, requires careful management of interest rate risk and refinancing risk.
*   **Receivables:** The increase in trade receivables needs to be examined in relation to sales growth and industry benchmarks.

#### Recommendations:

1.  **Detailed Analysis of Asset Growth:** Investigate the specific investments in PPE, inventories, and other non-current assets. What projects are driving these increases? What are the expected returns?
2.  **Working Capital Optimization:** Focus on reducing the inventory holding period and potentially improving the collection cycle for trade receivables.
3.  **Debt Management:** Given the variable interest rate exposure, consider hedging strategies. Evaluate the refinancing risk associated with the large portion of current borrowings.
4.  **Industry Benchmarking:** Continuously compare key financial ratios and performance metrics with direct competitors in the automotive component manufacturing sector to assess relative performance.

This analysis provides a starting point. A more comprehensive assessment would require more detailed information, including industry-specific benchmarks, management discussions, and potentially, access to internal company projections.

*   FY 2022-23: 10.2%
*   There is a decline.

#### Trends
*   The profit margins have slightly decreased from last financial year.

### Operating Leverage
*   RACL Geartech, as a manufacturing company, likely has a significant degree of operating leverage due to its investment in plant, property, and equipment (PP&E). This means that changes in sales volume can have a magnified impact on operating income.

### Non-Recurring Items
*   The report does not explicitly mention any material non-recurring or exceptional items for the year ended March 31, 2024. The P&L Statement includes a line item for "Exceptional Items," but it's reported as zero for both years.

### GAAP vs. Non-GAAP Reconciliation
*   The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), which are converged with IFRS. There is no need for a GAAP vs. Non-GAAP reconciliation in this context, as Ind AS are the applicable GAAP.

### EPS Analysis
#### Standalone
*   FY 2023-24:
    *   Basic EPS: Rs. 36.92
    *   Diluted EPS: Rs. 36.92
*   FY 2022-23:
    *   Basic EPS: Rs. 34.73
    *   Diluted EPS: Rs. 34.73

#### Consolidated
* Basic and Diluted are the same for FY24 at 36.54
* Basic and Diluted are the same for FY23 at 34.73
* Since Basic and Diluted EPS are identical, there are no dilutive potential equity shares (like stock options or convertible securities) outstanding.

### Key Observations and Further Analysis Points
*   **Growth:** RACL Geartech demonstrates substantial revenue growth. Understanding the drivers of this growth (volume, pricing, new products, new markets) is crucial.
*   **Margins:** While profitable, the company needs to monitor the slight decrease in margins. Further investigation into the cost of goods sold and operating expenses is needed to identify the reasons for the decline.
*   **Exports:** The high percentage of revenue from exports (73%) indicates a significant reliance on international markets. This exposes the company to currency risk and global economic conditions. The company mentions "natural hedging," but details on hedging strategies would be beneficial.
*   **Investments:** The company is investing significantly in capital expenditures (as seen in the purchase of PPE). Understanding the nature of these investments and their expected returns is important.
*   **Working Capital:** A review of the working capital cycle (inventory days, receivables days, payables days) would provide insights into operational efficiency.
*   **Debt:** Debt level increased significantly and needs further analysis.

### Data Needed For Further Analysis
*   Detailed breakdown of "Other Expenses."
*   Information on pricing and volume changes.
*   Details on hedging strategies (if any).
*   Quarterly financial results.
*   Breakdown of Capex investments.
*   Information on any significant contracts or customer relationships.
*   Industry-specific benchmarks and competitor analysis.

| **Net Cash from Financing (FCF)** |  **5,861.00**    |   **1,168.79**   |

#### Key Observations

*   **OCF Decline:** While operating profit before working capital changes *increased*, a significant *outflow* related to working capital changes (primarily increases in inventories and trade receivables) led to a substantial decline in OCF. This is a major area of concern.
*   **High Capex:** The company is heavily investing, with significant cash outflows for the purchase of PPE and advances for PPE. This signifies an expansion or upgrade phase, but the negative impact on free cash flow is considerable.
*   **Financing Dependence:** The company relied heavily on financing activities (borrowings) to fund its operations and investments, as OCF was insufficient to cover ICF.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** The company had a significantly negative free cash flow in 2024 due to the large Capex and reduced OCF.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Deterioration:** The large negative working capital change in the OCF calculation indicates a *deterioration* in working capital management efficiency. Specifically, large increases in inventory and trade receivables suggest:
    *   **Inventory:** Potential issues with inventory management, possibly due to overstocking, slower-moving inventory, or production inefficiencies.
    *   **Trade Receivables:** Difficulty in collecting payments from customers, potentially due to lenient credit terms, customer financial difficulties, or internal collection process issues.

*   **Working Capital Turnover:** The provided report shows a declining Net Capital turnover Ratio, which went down by 27.5%. Which highlights the ineffeciency in working capital management.

*   **Key Metrics (from the provided data):**
    *   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Declined from 4.72 times to 3.69 times. This confirms the worsening inventory management, with inventory taking longer to convert to sales.
    *   **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:** Decreased slightly from 4.44 times to 4.19 times, also signaling a minor slowdown in collections.
    *   **Trade Payables Turnover Ratio:** Decreased from 7.2 times to 6.37 times. The company is paying its suppliers slower.

### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividend:** The company declared and paid a dividend of ₹1.50 per share in both 2023 and 2024, a payout ratio of 4.5% and 4.8% respectively. This suggests a relatively conservative dividend policy.
*   **Share Buyback:** There is no mention of any share buyback activity in the provided document.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR):** Calculated as (Net Profit After Taxes + Depreciation + Interest Expense) / (Total Debt Repaid + Interest).
    *   2024: (3940.08+ 2392.59 + 2207.74) / (2369.44+ 2207.74) = 1.83 times
    *   2023: (3745.07 + 1853.16 + 2108.71) / (2683.85+ 2108.71) = 1.60 times
* The reported DSCR is 1.39 times. The calculation for the ratio in the report is different than the formula.
*The ratios are somewhat over 1, but due to the operating cash flow decline and high CAPEX requirements, management should make sure that they have enough cash flow and a strong credit rating in case they need to borrow more.

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Current Ratio:**
    *   2024: 26,797.05 / 24,633.88= 1.09
    *   2023: 19,935.70 / 17,448.45 = 1.14

*   **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** The balance sheet shows a small amount of cash and cash equivalents, and the amount has decreased compared to last year.
* The Current Ratio is getting close to 1, which is low, but still not a significant risk at this point.

*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** It's highly likely that the CCC has *increased*, meaning the company is taking longer to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash.

### Free Cash Flow Yield Trends

*   **Free Cash Flow Yield:** The Company's FCF is at negative 5402.2 lakhs

### Summary and Recommendations

RACL Geartech is in a period of significant investment and expansion, but this is putting a strain on its financial performance.

*   **Deteriorating Working Capital Management:** The company needs to urgently address its working capital management. This includes:
    *   **Inventory Control:** Implement better inventory forecasting, reduce excess stock, and optimize production processes.
    *   **Receivables Management:** Strengthen credit policies, improve collection efforts, and potentially review customer payment terms.
    *   **Payables Management:** While slowing down payments to suppliers can temporarily improve cash flow, it's not a sustainable solution and can damage supplier relationships.

*   **High Capital Expenditure:** While investment is necessary for growth, the company needs to carefully evaluate the returns on these investments and ensure they align with the overall strategic goals. Consider:
    *   **Prioritization:** Focus on the most critical and strategically important projects.
    *   **Phased Approach:** If possible, phase the investments to better manage cash flow.
    *   **Financing Mix:** Explore a mix of debt and equity financing to optimize the capital structure.

*   **Dependence on Borrowings:** The company's reliance on borrowings to fund its operations and investments is a concern. It increases financial risk and interest expenses.

*   **Monitor Key Metrics:** Regularly track and analyze key financial metrics such as OCF, FCF, working capital ratios, DSCR, and liquidity ratios.

*   **Communicate with Stakeholders:** Maintain transparent communication with investors, lenders, and other stakeholders regarding the company's financial performance and plans.

RACL Geartech needs to strike a balance between its growth ambitions and its financial health. Addressing the working capital issues and carefully managing its cash flow will be crucial for its long-term sustainability.
