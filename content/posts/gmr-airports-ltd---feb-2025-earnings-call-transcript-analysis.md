### Comparison with Previous Periods

*   Q1 FY25 income and EBITDA showed strong YoY growth.
*   EBITDA margin improved from Q4 FY24 to Q1 FY25.

### Revised Guidance or Forecasts

*   Delhi tariff order expected by the last quarter of FY25, effective from April 1, 2024.

### Areas of Growth or Decline

*   **Growth:** Overall traffic (7% YoY), international passenger traffic, income and EBITDA across all key airports (Delhi, Hyderabad, Goa). Non-aero revenue per pax at Delhi saw a 2-3% increase. Hyderabad saw strong aero and non-aero revenue growth.
*   **Decline/Pressure:** Overall profitability impacted by higher finance and depreciation costs. EBITDA growth at Delhi (3.8%) was slower than passenger growth (7%) and income growth (7.5%), attributed to being "under base airport charges" awaiting tariff revision.
