## Risk Assessment: Natural Gas Business

### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The company's complete reliance on natural gas makes it highly susceptible to market shifts.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Government targets to increase natural gas share in the energy mix to 15% by 2030 present both opportunities and competitive threats. PNGRB authorized area will affect market share.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. Competition from other fuels and regulatory changes (expiry of infrastructure exclusivity, challenges by Mahanagar Gas Limited) are intensifying.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Expansion into new geographic areas, development of CNG station infrastructure (FDODO scheme), and partnerships with OMCs (HPCL, BPCL, IOCL).
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. Connecting new customers (1.87 lakh PNG, 33 new CNG stations) but facing regulatory and competitive pressures.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant. The company's revenue and profitability will highly depend on the gas price.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** High. Potential for major accidents, supply disruptions, and asset integrity issues.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. New geographic areas increase risk due to virtual pipeline network and CNG/LNG decompression, and new projects like Green H2 blending.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:** QHSE management, risk assessment studies, compliance audits (ERDMP, T4S, IMS), mock drills, employee training programs, and contractor performance evaluations.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Good for most, with Key Safety Index. LTIF is 0.209 (FY 2023-24), 90% Compliance to the Asset integrity in FY 2023-24, Mock-drills level -1 (106), level-2(38), level -3 (25), ~94% Compliance of GGL lifesaving rules. 95% Compliance of HSE imporvment plan.

*   **Trend**: Fluctuating. Current Ratio increased (1.66 from 1.40), while Return on Net Worth decreased (15.36% from 23.83%).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Digitization of critical processes and investment in IT infrastructure. Pass through mechnaism of cost.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Moderate. Debtors Turnover is decreasing, and Inventory Turnover ratio decreasing. No outstanding loan and healthy net cash inflow.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Net profit after tax (Total comprehensive income) for the current financial year 2023-24 decreased to ' 1,151.43 Crores from ' 1,533.99 Crores in the previous year.
*   **Quantitative risk metrics and year-over-year changes:**
