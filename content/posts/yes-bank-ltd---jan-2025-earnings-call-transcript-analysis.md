### Comparison

PPoP showed strong sequential and YoY growth. NIM remained flat despite RIDF reduction (timing effect) and strong CASA growth, indicating pressure from deposit costs/yields. Fee income growth robust. Deposit growth strong YoY, particularly CASA. Advances growth moderate, driven by Wholesale, while Retail was deliberately slowed. Asset quality metrics stable/improving.

### Guidance/Forecasts

*   On track for INR 5,000 crores Recoveries & Resolutions guidance for FY25.
*   Net SR carrying value expected to be negligible/NIL by end of FY25.
*   Future recoveries from the written-down SR pool expected (~INR 1,200 cr/year, ~INR 3,000 cr total over time).
*   Credit Cost: Indicated a potential range around 30 bps of total assets going forward (below the earlier stated <50 bps comfort level), though explicitly stated "this is not a guidance".
*   RIDF target: Below 5% of assets over the next 2-3 years.
*   NIM: Expect improvement going forward, especially from next FY, driven by RIDF impact and retail recalibration.
