## NHPC Limited FY 2023-24 Financial Performance Analysis

### Revenue and Profitability

NHPC Limited reported a standalone Profit After Tax (PAT) of ₹3,743.94 crore for FY 2023-24, a slight decrease from ₹3,833.79 crore in FY 2022-23. Consolidated net profit stood at ₹4,028.01 crore compared to ₹4,260.83 crore in the previous year.

Total standalone income for FY 2023-24 was ₹10,024.99 crore, marginally down from ₹10,150.90 crore in FY 2022-23. Revenue from Operations (standalone) amounted to ₹8,404.92 crore in FY24, compared to ₹9,316.34 crore in FY23. This decline was primarily attributed to lower energy sales.

Sale of Energy (standalone) decreased by 12.79% to ₹7,327.90 crore in FY24 from ₹8,404.65 crore in FY23, mainly due to reduced generation and a decrease in sales pertaining to earlier years. Incentive income also fell to ₹457.81 crore from ₹675.68 crore. The average selling price (adjusted) was ₹4.21/unit for 19,138 MU sold in FY24, up from ₹3.97/unit for 21,622 MU in FY23.

Other Operating Income (standalone) increased significantly by 201.45% to ₹379.68 crore, largely due to interest from beneficiary states on revised tariffs. Other Income (standalone) also rose by 94.12% to ₹1,620.07 crore, buoyed by higher dividend income (₹497.54 crore), income from insurance claims (₹381.92 crore), and realization of business interruption loss (₹149.86 crore).

### Operational Performance

Total generation across NHPC's standalone power stations was 21,779 Million Units (MUs) in FY24, down from 24,907 MUs in FY23. This included 21,615 MU from hydro, 72 MU from wind, and 92 MU from solar. The overall Plant Availability Factor (PAF) for FY24 was 77.60%, compared to 88.75% in FY23. The normative PAF for FY24 was 77.35%.

The decrease in generation was attributed to flash floods in Himachal Pradesh (July 2023) and Sikkim (October 2023), and overall lower water inflow. Despite this, six power stations met their annual design energy targets, and ten achieved their normative PAF.

Renovation & Modernization of the 105 MW Loktak Power Station is underway, with an approved DPR cost of ₹273.59 crore (Sept 2017 PL), aiming to increase design energy from 448 MU to 562.73 MU.

### Expenditure Analysis

Total standalone expenditure increased by 7.10% to ₹5,962.79 crore in FY24.

#### Generation Expenses

Decreased to ₹814.27 crore from ₹936.46 crore, primarily due to reversal of water cess liability in Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim.

#### Employee Benefit Expenses

Marginally decreased to ₹1,296.58 crore. Employee strength as of March 31, 2024, was 4,929.

#### Finance Costs

Decreased by 10.72% to ₹425.13 crore due to loan repayments and changes in weighted average interest rates.

#### Depreciation & Amortization

Decreased by 3.01% to ₹1,111.00 crore, mainly due to Sewa-II Power Station completing 12 years of life in FY23.

#### Other Expenses

Increased by 35.59% to ₹2,315.81 crore, driven by higher losses on insured assets (₹407.68 crore), insurance expenses (₹125.35 crore), interest on arbitration cases (₹183.11 crore), and interest to beneficiary states (₹69.27 crore).

## NHPC Limited FY 2023-24 Analysis

### Financial Performance Analysis (FY 2023-24)

NHPC Limited reported a mixed financial performance for the fiscal year 2023-24. On a standalone basis, Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at ₹3,743.94 crore, a slight decrease from ₹3,833.79 crore in the previous year. Total standalone income also saw a marginal decline to ₹10,024.99 crore from ₹10,150.90 crore in FY23. Revenue from Operations (standalone) was ₹8,404.92 crore, down from ₹9,316.34 crore in the prior year. This decrease in operational revenue and PAT is primarily attributed to lower generation. Consolidated Net Profit was ₹4,028.01 crore compared to ₹4,260.83 crore in FY23, on a consolidated total income of ₹10,898.78 crore (FY23: ₹11,509.09 crore).

The company's Net Worth (standalone) increased to ₹37,268.61 crore as of March 31, 2024, from ₹35,407.96 a year earlier. EBITDA (standalone) remained relatively stable at ₹5,733.88 crore against ₹5,743.43 crore in FY23. However, the EBITDA margin (standalone) improved to 68.22% from 61.65%, likely due to changes in the revenue mix or cost management efficiencies despite lower generation.

The Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹0.50 per equity share, which, combined with the interim dividend of ₹1.40 per share, results in a total dividend of ₹1.90 per share for FY24. This amounts to a total payout of ₹1,908.55 crore, representing approximately 51% of standalone PAT and 5.12% of standalone Net Worth, adhering to the company's dividend distribution policy.

Key financial ratios indicate a stable financial structure. The Debt-Equity Ratio (standalone) was 0.84 as of March 31, 2024, compared to 0.85 in the previous year. The Return on Net Worth (standalone) decreased to 10.30% from 11.13% YoY, reflecting the dip in profitability. The Price to Earning (PE) ratio saw a significant increase to 24.03 from 10.52, driven largely by the appreciation in market price per share. Interest Service Coverage Ratio (standalone) improved to 3.16 from 3.01.

### Operational Performance Analysis (FY 2023-24)

NHPC's power stations generated a total of 21,779 Million Units (MUs) during FY24, a decrease from 24,907 MUs in FY23. The overall Plant Availability Factor (PAF) was 77.60%, down from 88.75% in the previous year. The reduction in generation and PAF was attributed to flash floods in the Himachal region in July 2023, unprecedented flash floods from Lhonak Lake affecting the Teesta Basin projects in October 2023, and generally lower water inflows. Despite these challenges, six power stations achieved their annual design energy targets, and ten power stations met their normative PAF. Parbati-II HE Project (800 MW) commenced infirm power generation.

Significant progress was made on key under-construction projects. The Subansiri Lower HE Project (2000 MW) saw the installation of Spillway Radial Gates Nos. 7, 8, and 9, with three units expected to be commissioned by March 2025 and all units by May 2026. The foundation stone for India's largest hydroelectric project, the 2880 MW Dibang Multipurpose Project, was laid, and Dirki Nalla diversion was completed, ensuring all-weather road access. Lanco Teesta Hydro Power Limited (LTHPL - Teesta Stage-VI, 500 MW) and Jalpower Corporation Limited (JPCL - Rangit-IV, 120 MW) projects, being executed by wholly-owned subsidiaries, achieved physical progress of 61.63% and 72.65% respectively. Projects under CVPPL (Pakal Dul, Kiru, Kwar) and RHPCL (Ratle) also reported ongoing construction activities.

### Strategic Developments and New Initiatives

NHPC is actively pursuing diversification into renewable energy and pumped storage projects (PSPs). The company signed MOUs for developing approximately 11,375 MW of PSPs across Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and other states. In solar energy, NHPC is implementing 1000 MW under the CPSU Scheme (including the 300 MW Bikaner Solar Plant, for which the foundation stone was laid), has 700 MW commissioned under REIA Tranche-I (including the inaugurated 380 MW Jaisalmer Solar Project), and won 400 MW in TBCB for GSECL's Khavda solar park. An MOU for 10,000 MW RE parks in Rajasthan was signed by its subsidiary NHPC REL.

The company is also venturing into Green Hydrogen, with pilot projects initiated in Leh, Kargil, and Chamba. Internationally, NHPC is progressing with DPR preparation for West Seti (750 MW), Seti River (SR6) (450 MW), and Phukot Karnali (480 MW) HE Projects in Nepal.

Financially, NHPC raised ₹2,000 crore through bank term loans and ₹2,046.94 crore via monetization of RoE from Kishanganga Power Station. It also secured a JPY 20 billion loan from JBIC for renewable energy projects.

2.  **Contingent Liabilities - against claims from Contractors:** Significant claims and litigations are pending, requiring management judgment in estimating amounts to be disclosed as contingent liabilities.
3.  **Recognition of MAT Credit and Regulatory Deferral (Credit) balances:** Assessment of recoverability of MAT credit and related regulatory deferral balances involves judgment on future taxable profits.

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

The Joint Statutory Auditors issued an **unmodified opinion**, stating that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit, consolidated total comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity, and consolidated cash flows of the Group and its Joint Venture for the year ended March 31, 2024.
