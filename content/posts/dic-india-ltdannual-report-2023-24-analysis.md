#### Significant Changes in Major Line Items (>10% YoY)

Several line items show significant changes (greater than 10% YoY):

*   **Capital Work-in-Progress (Non-Current Assets):** Decreased significantly by 46.38%, likely due to the completion and capitalization of projects or potentially project cancellations/deferrals.
*   **Deferred Tax Assets (Non-Current Assets):** Decrease of 28.46%.
*   **Non-Current Tax Assets (Net):** Increase of 36.25%.
*   **Inventories (Current Assets):** Increased by 12.84%, potentially indicating increased production or slower sales.
*   **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Decreased by 19.75%
*   **Lease Liabilities (Non-current):** Decrease of 35.7%.
*   **Borrowings (Current Liabilities):** Decreased by 100%, indicating the Company repaid all its short-term borrowings.
*   **Trade Payables (MSME):** Increase of 20.66%
*   **Other Current Liabilities:** Increase of 17.15%.
*   **Current Tax Liabilities (Net):** Substantial increase, indicating a larger tax liability in the current year.

#### Working Capital Trends

Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

*   **2024:** 42,207.44 - 16,857.73 = 25,349.71
*   **2023:** 39,656.16 - 17,700.05 = 21,956.11

Working capital increased from 2023 to 2024. The increase is driven primarily by an increase in Trade receivables and inventories, while cash decreased.

#### Asset Quality Metrics

| Metric                     | 2024  | 2023  |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| PP&E Turnover             | 6.75  | Cannot calculate        |
|Fixed Asset Turnover|5.87|Cannot calculate|
| Inventory Turnover|5.85|5.79|
| Trade Receivables Turnover | 3.77|Cannot calculate|

*   **Impairment:** The notes mention an impairment reversal/charge related to the Kolkata Plant closure.

The inventory turnover increase is minor. The trade receivables turnover is slower, suggesting potential collection issues or longer credit terms.

#### Debt Structure and Maturity Profile

| Metric                    | 2024    | 2023  |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Debt-to-Equity Ratio      |  0.016       |    0.06             |
| Interest Coverage Ratio   |  27.75       | Cannot Calculate  |

*   **Maturity Profile:**
    *   **Short-Term Borrowings:** Reduced to zero in 2024.
    *   **Lease Liabilities:** Split between current (341.49) and non-current (342.70).
    *   Trade payable aging is provided in point 22.

The company significantly reduced its debt burden in 2024. The debt-to-equity ratio is very low. The interest coverage ratio is high.

#### Off-Balance Sheet Items

*   **Contingent Liabilities:** Note 37 details contingent liabilities related to tax disputes and claims:
    *   Income Tax Matters: Not quantified
    *   Custom Duty Matters: INR 140.91 Lakhs
    *   Excise Duty Matters: INR 836.06 Lakhs
    *   Service Tax Matters: INR 1,162.86 Lakhs
    *   Sales Tax/VAT/Entry Tax Matters: INR 383.16 Lakhs
    *   Goods and Services Tax: INR 41.16 Lakhs
*   **Commitments:** Note 37(b) mentions capital commitments, but there are amounts specified.

The most significant off-balance sheet items are the contingent liabilities related to tax disputes.

#### Conclusion

DIC India Limited shows a strong financial position in 2024, with low debt, increased working capital, and a reasonable asset turnover. However, the increase in inventory, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and the significant contingent liabilities warrant further investigation. The company's proactive reduction of debt is a positive sign, but the reasons behind the shifts in asset composition and the potential impact of the contingent liabilities need to be carefully considered. The sharp increase in current tax liabilities also requires explanation.

## Financial Analysis of DIC India Limited

### Revenue Breakdown by Segment/Geography with Growth Rates:

*   **Segment:** DIC India Limited operates primarily in a single segment: "Printing Inks," which includes newsprint ink, offset ink, and liquid ink used in newspapers, other publications, and packaging industries, also provides lamination adhesive. Because it's a single segment, there's no further breakdown by product lines in the financial statements.
*   **Geography:**
    *   **Domestic:** Revenue for FY24: ₹78,539.34 lakhs. Revenue for FY23: ₹74,449.15 lakhs. Growth: 5.5%
    *   **Export (including deemed exports):** Revenue for FY24: ₹9,613.55 lakhs. Revenue for FY23: ₹8,435.99 lakhs. Growth: 13.96%
    * Total Revenue has grown from 82,885.14 Lakhs to 88,152.89 Lakhs, that is by 6.35%.

### Cost Structure Analysis:

The major cost components for DIC India Limited are:

*   **Cost of Materials Consumed:** This is the largest expense, representing 67.7% of total revenue in FY24 (₹59,679.91 lakhs) and 69.5% in FY23 (₹57,645.70 lakhs).
*   **Purchase of Stock-in-trade:** 8.14% of Total income in FY24, and 5.84% in FY23.
*  **Changes in Inventories:** Negative figure represent increase in Inventory.
*   **Employee Benefits Expense:** Represents 7.6% of total revenue in FY24 (₹6,682.15 lakhs) and 8.9% in FY23 (₹7,413.68 lakhs).
*   **Other Expenses:** A significant category, making up 13.02% of total revenue in FY24 (₹11,477.46 lakhs), and 14.09% in FY23 (₹11,684.03 lakhs). This includes a wide variety of costs like power and fuel, freight and forwarding, royalty, and legal/professional fees.
*   **Depreciation and Amortization:** Relatively stable at 1.92% of total revenue in FY24.

### Margin Analysis:

*   **There is no gross profit data, as cost of goods sold data is split into many components.**
#### EBIT Margin:

*   FY24: (Profit before tax + Finance costs) / Total Income = (2,433.29 + 89.29)/89,169.63= 2.82%
*   FY23: (Loss before tax + Finance costs) / Total Income = (-634.29 + 139.31)/83,789.73= -0.59%
#### Net Profit Margin:

*   FY24: Net Profit / Total Income = 1,914.23 / 89,169.63= 2.15%
*   FY23: Net Loss / Total Income = (2,267.62) / 83,789.73 = -2.71%

#### Margin Trend:

The EBIT and Net margins both show a shift from loss in 2023 to profit in 2024, indicating a good recovery.

### Operating Leverage:

*   It's difficult to precisely calculate the degree of operating leverage (DOL) without a more detailed breakdown of fixed vs. variable costs. It can be observed that the Company has high fixed cost assets, and the fixed cost would comprise of manufacturing cost, employee cost, and administrative cost.

### Non-Recurring Items:

*   **Exceptional Items:** In FY23, there was a significant exceptional item of ₹(2,299.00) lakhs. It related to the Kolkata plant closure, and includes impairment reversals/charges, write-offs of property, plant and equipment, staff separation costs, and legal/ancillary costs. There were no exceptional items in FY24.

### GAAP vs. Non-GAAP Reconciliation:

*   The provided financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), which are converged with IFRS. There is no presentation of non-GAAP measures that would require reconciliation.

### EPS Analysis:

*   **FY24:**
    *   Basic EPS: ₹20.85
    *   Diluted EPS: ₹20.85
*   **FY23:**
    *   Basic EPS: ₹(24.71)
    *   Diluted EPS: ₹(24.71)

The EPS shifted from negative to positive. Because there were no potentially dilutive securities (like convertible bonds or stock options), basic and diluted EPS are the same.

*   **ROE:**  Measures the return generated on shareholders' equity.   The significant improvement in 2024 indicates a return to profitability.

*   **ROIC:** Measures the return on the total capital invested (both equity and debt). Here, I'm considering, "Capital Employed" from the report. A positive ROIC in 2024 is an improvement after two years of very low returns.
*   **Margins:**
    *   **Gross Profit Margin:** Calculated from (Revenue - Cost of Materials Consumed - Changes in inventories + Purchase of stock in trade) / Revenue. Remains relatively stable, showing effective Cost of Sales.
    *   **Operating Profit Margin:**  Calculated as (Revenue - Operating Expenses) / Revenue, where Operating Expenses include Cost of Materials Consumed, Purchases of stock-in-trade, Change in Inventory, Employee benefit, Depreciation, Other expenses. Improvement in 2024 is likely.
    *   **Net Profit Margin:**  Net income divided by revenue. The shift from a negative margin in 2023 to a positive margin in 2024 is the most critical observation.

*   **Current Ratio:**  A healthy current ratio, consistently above 2.0, indicates a strong ability to meet short-term obligations.
