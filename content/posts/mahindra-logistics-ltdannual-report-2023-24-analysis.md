## Cash Management: Mahindra Logistics Limited - Financial Analysis Report FY 2023-24

### Cash Flow and Liquidity Analysis

#### Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

*   **Standalone:** OCF significantly increased to ₹264.22 crores in FY24 from ₹153.18 crores in FY23. This improvement is primarily driven by higher Profit Before Tax (PBT) and favorable movements in operating expenses despite some adverse working capital changes (increase in receivables).
*   **Consolidated:** OCF remained relatively stable at ₹120.31 crores in FY24 compared to ₹119.50 crores in FY23. Higher PBT was offset by significant negative working capital adjustments, particularly increased trade receivables.

#### Investing Cash Flow (ICF)

*   **Standalone:** Net cash used in investing activities was ₹120.69 crores in FY24 (FY23: ₹129.33 crores). Major outflows include capex (₹66.41 crores) and investments in subsidiaries. Proceeds from the sale of current investments partially offset outflows.
*   **Consolidated:** Net cash used in investing activities increased to ₹225.08 crores in FY24 (FY23: ₹157.69 crores). This includes capex (₹71.72 crores), significant investments in subsidiaries (like ZipZap), and payments for business acquisitions.

#### Financing Cash Flow (FCF)

*   **Standalone:** Net cash used in financing activities was ₹178.16 crores in FY24, a significant outflow compared to ₹6.10 crores used in FY23. This was mainly due to repayment of short-term borrowings (net outflow of ₹68.00 crores vs net inflow in FY23), lease liability payments (₹79.39 crores), and dividend payment (₹18.01 crores).
*   **Consolidated:** Net cash generated from financing activities was ₹159.23 crores in FY24 (FY23: ₹30.73 crores). This was driven by proceeds from borrowings (net ₹52.83 crores), offsetting lease payments (₹97.64 crores) and dividend payment (₹18.01 crores).

#### Free Cash Flow (FCF)

*   **Standalone:** FCF saw a substantial increase to ₹197.81 crores in FY24 from ₹83.08 crores in FY23, driven by higher OCF and slightly lower capex.
*   **Consolidated:** FCF remained relatively stable at ₹48.59 crores in FY24 compared to ₹49.33 crores in FY23, as stable OCF was slightly offset by marginally higher capex.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Overall Trend:** Both standalone and consolidated operations saw pressure on working capital during FY24, primarily due to an increase in trade receivables, reflected in the OCF adjustments.
*   **Receivables:** Standalone Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio decreased slightly from 5.46x to 5.06x, indicating a marginal increase in the collection period. Consolidated receivables also increased.
*   **Payables:** Standalone Trade Payables Turnover Ratio decreased marginally from 4.50x to 4.31x, suggesting a slight extension in the payment cycle.
*   **Inventories:** Inventory levels remain minimal relative to turnover, consistent with the asset-light logistics model. Standalone Inventory Turnover Ratio decreased significantly, although inventory is not a core operational driver.
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** Calculation is limited by the lack of clear Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) data typical for a service industry. However, the increase in receivables relative to payables suggests potential elongation of the CCC.

### Capital Expenditure (Capex) Analysis

*   **Standalone:** ₹66.41 crores in FY24 (FY23: ₹70.10 crores).
*   **Consolidated:** ₹71.72 crores in

## Financial Analysis Report: Mahindra Logistics Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Ref: MLLSEC/90/2024 & Integrated Annual Report FY 2023-24

### Profitability Analysis

#### Consolidated Performance:

*   Revenue from Operations: Increased by 7.36% YoY to ₹5,505.97 crores in FY24 from ₹5,128.29 crores in FY23.
*   Gross Margin: Declined to 9.5% in FY24 from 10.0% in FY23.
*   EBITDA: Decreased by 11.83% YoY to ₹229.04 crores in FY24 from ₹260.04 crores in FY23. EBITDA margin contracted to 4.2% in FY24 from 5.1% in FY23.
*   Profit/(Loss) Before Tax (PBT): Recorded a loss of ₹(26.40) crores in FY24 compared to a profit of ₹38.32 crores in FY23.
*   Profit/(Loss) After Tax (PAT): Reported a net loss of ₹(54.74) crores in FY24 against a net profit of ₹26.28 crores in FY23. Adjusted PAT (excluding B2B express impacts and one-time charges) is stated as ₹69 crores.
*   Return on Equity (ROE): Negative at (10.39)% in FY24 compared to 4.74% in FY23, driven by the net loss.
*   Return on Capital Employed (ROCE): Declined significantly to 0.18% in FY24 from 6.76% in FY23, reflecting lower profitability on the capital deployed.

#### Standalone Performance:

*   Revenue from Operations: Marginal increase of 1.59% YoY to ₹4,529.90 crores in FY24.
*   Gross Margin: Improved to 11.1% in FY24 from 10.5% in FY23.
*   EBITDA: Increased nominally by 5.83% YoY to ₹292.39 crores in FY24.
*   PBT: Increased by 6.35% YoY to ₹85.55 crores in FY24. PBT adjusted for one-time charges (₹12 crores) grew by approximately 21% YoY.
*   PAT: Declined marginally to ₹61.98 crores in FY24 from ₹64.53 crores in FY23.
*   ROE: Declined to 9.51% in FY24 from 10.73% in FY23.
*   ROCE: Marginally declined to 12.22% in FY24 from 12.75% in FY23.

#### Observations:

*   Consolidated profitability was significantly impacted by the performance of subsidiaries, particularly the B2B Express business (MLL Express/Rivigo integration) and one-time charges (₹12 crores).
*   Standalone performance showed resilience with margin improvement and PBT growth (adjusted for one-time charges), contrasting sharply with the consolidated loss.
*   The decline in consolidated margins and the shift to a net loss position require close monitoring, particularly concerning the integration and turnaround of acquired businesses.

### Liquidity Analysis

*   Current Ratio: Stood at 0.88x in FY24 compared to 0.94x in FY23 (Consolidated).
*   Quick Ratio (Acid-Test): (Calculation requires specific current asset breakdown not fully detailed in excerpts, but would be lower than Current Ratio due to exclusion of inventory).
*   Cash Ratio: (Calculation requires Cash & Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities data). Cash and equivalents stood at ₹71.07 crores (Consolidated) as of March 31, 2024, down from ₹126.23 crores in FY23.

#### Observations:

*   The Current Ratio below 1.0x suggests potential pressure on short-term liquidity, although this is common in asset-light models with efficient working capital cycles. The slight decline YoY warrants observation.
*   The decrease in cash and cash equivalents indicates significant cash utilization, likely in operations, investments (acquisitions), and financing activities (repayments/dividend).

### Efficiency Analysis

*   Asset Turnover Ratio: (Consolidated Revenue / Average Total Assets). Calculation needs FY23 Total Assets for average. Based on FY24 data (Revenue ₹5506 Cr / Assets ₹2686 Cr), a single-year ratio is approx 2.05x. A declining trend might indicate asset base growing faster than revenue, possibly due to acquisitions.
*   Inventory Turnover Ratio: Decreased sharply to 1.00x in FY24 from 7.64x in FY23 (Standalone). This indicates slower movement or changes in the nature of inventory held, though inventory is a minor part of the overall business.
*   Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio: Decreased to 5.06x in FY24 from 5.46x in FY23 (Standalone), suggesting a slight slowdown in collections or changes in credit terms. Consolidated receivables increased to ₹701.90 crores from ₹652.49 crores.

#### Observations:

*   Efficiency metrics show mixed results. While inventory turnover significantly slowed (standalone), the receivables cycle shows a marginal lengthening. The impact of acquisitions on overall asset turnover needs monitoring as synergies are realized.

### Leverage Analysis

*   Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Decreased significantly to 0.12x in FY24 from 0.24x in FY23 (Standalone). Consolidated total borrowings (Current + Non-Current) decreased to ₹193.88 crores in FY24 from ₹289.47 crores in FY23.
*   Interest Coverage Ratio (EBIT/Interest Expense): Declined sharply due to lower operating profit (Consolidated PBT was negative) and finance costs of ₹118.95 crores (Consolidated FY24). This indicates significantly reduced capacity to service interest payments from operating earnings in FY24. Standalone finance costs were ₹47.34 crores.

#### Observations:

*   The Group reduced its overall debt levels in FY24.
*   The sharp decline in interest coverage capability at the consolidated level is a key concern, driven primarily by the losses incurred, likely linked to the express business integration. Standalone interest coverage appears healthier.

### Segment Analysis

*   **Revenue Contribution (Consolidated FY24):**
    *   Supply Chain Management (SCM): 94.04% (₹5,177.97 crores)
    *   Enterprise Mobility Services (EMS): 5.96% (₹328.00 crores)
*   **Segment Results (EBIT - Consolidated FY24):**
    *   SCM: ₹(11.91) crores (Loss)
    *   EMS: ₹19.83 crores (Profit)
*   **ROIC:** Segment-level capital employed data is not provided in the reference material, preventing the calculation of Segment ROIC.

#### Observations:

*   The SCM segment, despite contributing the vast majority of revenue, reported an operating loss, primarily due to challenges in the B2B Express vertical.
*   The Mobility segment demonstrated a positive turnaround, contributing positively to EBIT. The MD&A notes profitability improvements in this segment, including the Meru acquisition integration.
*   Diversification benefits are currently offset by losses in the larger SCM segment's express business.
