    *   Volatility in global financial and commodity markets.
    *   Continued effect of high inflation, especially in rural areas, impacting consumer demand.
    *   Evolving competitive landscape.
    *   Macroeconomic challenges, inflation, and forex unavailability in key geographies (South Asia and Egypt) impacting International Business.

*   **Competitive Landscape:** The widening competitive landscape provides both a challenge (maintaining market share) and an opportunity (industry expansion, benefitting consumers with more choices).
*   **Renewable Energy Targets:** Failure to achieve renewable energy targets could increase operational costs and impact the Company's ESG rating. The current achievement of 65.8% renewable electricity in decorative paint manufacturing suggests a positive trajectory.
*   **Water Neutrality Targets:** Failure to achieve these could expose the Company to operational and reputational risks, especially in water-stressed regions (although currently, none of the Company's sites are in water-stressed areas as per CGWB classification).
*   **Exchange Rate Volatility:** The Company has experienced material impact for example the Egyptian Pound continued to be under pressure and depreciated by close to 53% by the end of FY 2023-24 on the back of an almost 66% depreciation in the previous year.
