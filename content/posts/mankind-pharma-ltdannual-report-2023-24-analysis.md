## Risk Framework

### Strategic Risks

*   **Severity:** High. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with both domestic and international players, putting pressure on pricing and market share.
*   **Likelihood:** High. The Indian pharmaceutical market is growing, but competition is intensifying.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. The number of INR 100 Cr. brand families increased, but growth rates in some key therapies are slowing.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Diversifying product portfolio, expanding into chronic therapies, pursuing inorganic growth (M&A, in-licensing), focusing on metro and tier-1 cities, and launching DMF grade API products.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. The chronic segment share increased to 36% in FY24, demonstrating success in diversification. Market share in key therapeutic segments presents a mix bag, with increases in some and decreases in others.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Revenue growth is dependent on successful execution of strategic initiatives; Failure to gain significant market share could lead to flat or declining revenue.

### Operational Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Disruptions in the supply chain can significantly impact production and profitability. Reliance on in-house manufacturing (75%) increases control but also concentrates operational risk.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Operational disruptions occurred, such as the temporary shutdown of the Sikkim plant due to floods.
*   **Trend:** Stable. Supply chain resilience strategies were effective in mitigating the impact of the Sikkim plant shutdown.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Diversifying sourcing, implementing advanced technologies like AI/ML for supply chain planning (Project Adapt), warehouse and distribution transformation (Project Wave), and adopting Lean and Six Sigma methodologies.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Effective. The Sikkim plant shutdown had minimal impact, and the Net Operating working capital days were optimized to 42 days.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Capex investments in new facilities and technology upgrades (INR 389 crore in FY24) represent ongoing operational investment.

### Financial Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Fluctuations in currency value can impact the cost of production and international revenue.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.
*   **Trend:** Stable.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Prudent financial planning including hedging mechanisms.
*   **Control Effectiveness**: Effective. Crisil & ICRA rating is AA+/ Stable.

*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Regulatory scrutiny is increasing, especially regarding product quality and pricing.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. Mentioned regulatory changes and updates (e.g., updated Schedule M) require constant adaptation.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implementing a strong compliance management system, establishing a Regulatory Monitoring Team, adhering to global quality standards (WHO GMP, USFDA certifications).
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Good. No major compliance breaches were reported.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Non-compliance could lead to financial penalties, product recalls, and market share loss.

### Emerging Risks

#### Cybersecurity/Data Privacy Risk:

*   **Severity:** High. Data breaches and non-compliance with data privacy regulations can cause significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal issues.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Increasing reliance on digital systems and data-driven insights makes cybersecurity a growing concern.
*   **Trend:** Increasing. The Company is actively strengthening its cybersecurity framework and working towards ISO 27001 certification.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implementing a seven-layer cybersecurity framework, adopting a 'Digital DNA' approach, investing in IT talent and solutions, and strict adherence to regulatory standards.
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Under assessment. The Company has not reported any data breaches in the current year.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Data breaches could lead to substantial financial losses, legal liabilities, and damage to brand reputation.

#### Patent Risk
