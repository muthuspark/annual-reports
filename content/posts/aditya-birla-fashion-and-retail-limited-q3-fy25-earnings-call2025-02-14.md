## Q&A Insights

*   **Lifestyle Brands LTL Performance:** Driven by a very strong festive and wedding performance. Prepared with the kind of assortments and a tepid winter. "We also, in some sense, consolidated our retail network... So that also augurs well for the overall network. And to that extent, we are also cranking up the expansion machinery once again."
*   **Pantaloons Premiumization:** "Distribution strategy is in line with our overall brand strategy, which is about premiumization...This is a bit of a reset to make sure that as a brand, we come together and we come through as a consistent brand across the pop strata."
*   **Style Up Strategy:** "Two-pronged strategy, 2 brands addressing 2 different consumer sets with their own separate distribution agenda."
*   **Store Closures and Learnings:** Lifestyle Brands closures due to smaller towns taking longer to recover. Pantaloons closures were a strategic call on a shift in premium positioning. TCNS rationalization post-acquisition.
*   **TMRW Growth and Profitability:** Business is growing organically at about 25% to 30%. "The intrinsic profitability of each of these brands is on a continuously improving path... We think over a period of time, as intrinsic profitability of the constituent brands of TMRW improves, that will be able to leverage the overhead that currently exists."
*   **Debt Levels:** ABLBL business is expected to start with a debt of INR700 crores, and ABFRL to start with a cash of between INR1,300 crores to INR1,500 crores.
*   **Ethnic Wear Margins:** Quarter 3 margins are exaggerated in the wedding and ethnic markets.
