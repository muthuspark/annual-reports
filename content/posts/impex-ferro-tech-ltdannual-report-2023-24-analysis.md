## Strategic Analysis of Impex Ferro Tech Limited

### Long-term Strategic Goals and Progress

Prior to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), Impex Ferro Tech Limited invested Rs. 2,358.77 lakhs in FY 2023-24 to revamp its Captive Power Plant (CPP) and Ferro Alloys Plant. While the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) referenced the ferroalloy industry's linkage to the iron and steel sector and the National Steel Policy 2017, the manufacturing plant has remained non-operational since October 2022.

The company's progress towards long-term goals has been superseded by its financial distress and admission into CIRP effective May 2, 2024. The immediate strategic goal is the successful resolution of the insolvency process.

### Competitive Advantages and Market Positioning

Impex Ferro Tech Limited was a manufacturer of ferroalloys in Eastern India. While the MD&A suggested potential in the Indian ferroalloy industry, the manufacturing plant's shutdown since October 2022 and the initiation of CIRP have undermined the company's competitive standing.

The company reported no income-generating business operations during the latter part of the review period, leading to an 80.82% decline in revenue from operations in FY24.

## Financial Analysis Report: Impex Ferro Tech Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The Independent Auditor, M/s. J. B. S. & Company, issued a **Qualified Opinion** on the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.

#### Bases for Qualified Opinion:

*   **Non-provision of Interest Expense:** Failure to provide for interest expense on borrowings amounting to Rs. 4,048.39 lakhs for FY 2023-24 (cumulative non-provisioning of Rs. 23,814.49 lakhs till March 31, 2024). This is not in accordance with Ind AS 23 (Borrowing Costs) and Ind AS 109 (Financial Instruments).
*   **Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Uncertainty:** Provisioning of ECL of Rs. 313.60 lakhs on Trade Receivables and Rs. 393.53 lakhs on Advances to parties was based on management's prudence due to long non-realization. The auditors were unable to comment on the carrying amount of these receivables due to a change in ECL policy.
*   **Balance Confirmations:** Trade payables, Advances from Customers, Advances to Suppliers, and other party balances are subject to confirmation/reconciliation. The auditors could not comment on the recoverability of these balances.
*   **CIRP Claims Verification:** Claims submitted by financial and operational creditors under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) exceeded amounts in the books. The verification and reconciliation process is ongoing, and no accounting impact for differences has been made.
*   **Limited Access to CIRP Information:** Certain confidential information related to the CIRP (e.g., Committee of Creditors meeting minutes) was not shared, preventing the auditors from commenting on possible financial impacts, presentation, and disclosures.

#### Material Uncertainty Relating to Going Concern:

The auditors highlighted a material uncertainty regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern due to accumulated losses, erosion of net worth, and liabilities exceeding assets. The appropriateness of the going concern basis for financial statement preparation is critically dependent on the outcome of the ongoing CIRP.

#### Emphasis of Matter:

*   Non-provision of arrear electricity bills of Rs. 968.54 lakhs demanded by Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), which is under challenge and pending before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL).

#### Key Audit Matters:

*   Claims and exposure relating to taxation litigation, including disputed claims/levies under various taxes and legal matters.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual basis, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS).

#### Significant Policies:

Include recognition of financial instruments (amortized cost, FVTOCI, FVTPL), property, plant & equipment (cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment), intangible assets (cost less accumulated amortization and impairment), inventories (lower of cost and net realizable value), impairment of financial and non-financial assets, revenue recognition, income tax (current and deferred), and borrowing costs.

#### Changes in Accounting Policy:

The auditor's qualification noted a "change the ECL policy" for receivables, which contributed to their inability to comment on the carrying amount of such receivables.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

The Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting states that, in their opinion, the company **has an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024.**

### Regulatory Compliance Status

The Secretarial Audit Report for FY 2023-24 highlights extensive non-compliances:

#### Companies Act, 2013:

*   Non-filing/incorrect filing of forms (MGT-14, DPT-3, MSME dues).
*   Advances from customers unappropriated for over 365 days (potential violation of deposit rules).
*   Outdated company website and incomplete Annual Report (FY 2022-23) online.
*   Statutory registers not updated; delays in MCA filings.

#### SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015:

*   Delayed publication of financial results (Reg 47)
