##### Key Observations:

*   **Strong Operating Cash Flow:** CareEdge consistently generates strong operating cash flow, driven by its core rating business. The significant increase in OCF for FY24 is due to higher profit and positive contributions from working capital management.
*   **Significant Investing Activities:** The large outflows in investing activities are primarily driven by the purchases/redemptions of investments.
*   **Financing Activities - Dividends and Buyback:** The company distributes a significant portion of its earnings to shareholders through dividends.

#### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Trade Receivables Ageing:** The aging schedule shows that most receivables are current (less than 6 months) and there are low disputed balances.
*   **Contract Assets & Liabilities:** The document indicates the presence of contract assets and liabilities.
    *   Increase in other current liabilities due to increase in Contract Liabilities from 1886.39 to 2832.68.
    *   Decrease in Trade Receivables and increase in Revenue from operations which indicates improved collection efficiency.

#### Dividend and Share Buyback Trends

*   **Dividends:** The company has a history of paying dividends.
    *   FY24: Interim dividend of Rs 7 per share and a proposed final dividend of Rs 11 per share.
    *   FY23: Interim of Rs 10 and final dividend of Rs 15.
*   **Share Buyback:** There is no Share buyback in FY24.

#### Debt Service Coverage

CareEdge is a "Debt Free Company." Therefore, traditional debt service coverage ratios are not applicable. There are lease liabilities, but the interest and principal payments on these are relatively small compared to the operating cash flow.

#### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Liquidity Position:** CareEdge appears to have a very strong liquidity position. The company holds significant cash and cash equivalents, as well as liquid mutual funds. The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) improved from 7.71 in FY23 to 6.55 in FY24, which is very high.

#### Free Cash Flow Yield Trends

Approximation of Free Cash Flow (FCF) using available information:

*   **FY24:** OCF (9,573.15) - Capex (244.51) = FCF ~ 9328.64
*   **FY23:** OCF (7,080.78) - Capex (1422.59) = FCF ~ 5,658.19
