#### Analysis
*   Cost of Materials Consumed as a percentage of revenue increased, potentially due to changes in product mix and pricing pressures on finished goods not fully offset by raw material cost decreases in some areas. While some key raw materials (sulphur, caustic soda, chloroform) saw price decreases, Fluorspar prices increased.
*   Employee benefits expense increased due to annual increments, and strengthening capabilities across functions.
*   Finance costs rose significantly, likely due to increased borrowings (e.g., ₹350 crores debt arranged by NFASL for the new HF plant) and potentially higher interest rates.
*   Depreciation increased due to capitalization of new assets, including the full-year impact of assets commissioned in the previous year (Dahej assets) and new capitalizations in FY24.
*   The significant swing in "Changes in Inventories" from a negative (build-up) in FY23 to a positive (draw-down/lower build-up) in FY24 indicates efforts to optimize working capital and destocking.

## Financial Performance Overview (FY2023-24)

Navin Fluorine International Limited (NFIL) reported consolidated total income of ₹2,121.28 crores for FY2023-24, a marginal decrease from ₹2,113.97 crores in FY2022-23. Revenue from operations was ₹2,065.01 crores, slightly down from ₹2,077.40 crores in the previous year. Consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at ₹271.07 crores.

Operating EBITDA (before exceptional items and other income) declined by 27.62% to ₹398.28 crores from ₹550.31 crores in FY2022-23. Consequently, the Operating EBITDA margin contracted significantly to 19.29% from 26.49%. This margin compression is attributed to a challenging market environment, including geopolitical tensions, inflation, higher interest rates, and destocking in the agrochemical sector, alongside a change in business mix, lower operating leverage, and pricing pressures in refrigerant gases in export markets. An exceptional gain of ₹52.13 crores was recorded from the sale of surplus unused colony land.

Net Debt to Equity ratio remained healthy at 0.37, within the company's guided framework of approximately 0.5x. The working capital cycle was maintained at around 104 days of turnover.

## Segmental Performance Analysis

### Specialty Chemicals

*   Revenue: ₹848 crores, registering a 14% year-on-year (YoY) growth. This segment contributed 41% to total revenue.
*   Drivers: Growth was driven by increased volumes and new product launches, particularly from the full operationalization of Dahej assets. The segment demonstrated resilience despite deferral of campaigns and channel inventory destocking in the agrochemical space.
*   Outlook: Focus on deepening relationships in crop science applications and incubating opportunities in performance materials, including electronic and semiconductor chemicals. The Dahej agro specialty capex is expected to be commissioned in 1H FY25, with POs secured for CY2024. A new capability in Surat is anticipated to generate revenue from FY26.

### High Performance Products (HPP)

*   Revenue: ₹955 crores, an 8% YoY growth, contributing 46% to total revenue.
*   Drivers: Growth was supported by the commencement of the new HFC R-32 plant.
*   Challenges: The segment faced pricing pressures in export markets (R22, HFO), a weak summer impacting refrigerant gas sales, and extended stabilization of the Orchid plant. HFO business was impacted by volume pressure due to weak US housing sector demand. R22 export pricing pressure stabilized in Q1 FY25.
*   Outlook: Expansion of R32 capacity by 4,500 MT (commissioning by February 2025) and a new 40,000 TPA HF plant at Dahej (NFASL, operational early CY2025) are key growth enablers. The strategy involves transitioning from HCFCs to HFCs and further to HFOs.

### Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation (CDMO)

*   Revenue: ₹262 crores, a decline of 42% YoY, contributing 13% to total revenue under the 'Navin Molecular' brand.
*   Challenges: Performance was impacted by delayed approvals of clinical phase molecules, the inherently volatile/campaign-based nature of the business, and postponement of commercial stage approvals for certain late-stage drugs. Plants operated at sub-optimal levels.
*   Developments: Multiple Master Service Agreements (MSAs) signed with a leading European CDMO for commercial products, expected to contribute significantly from FY26. The portfolio now comprises over 50% non-fluorinated molecules by revenue. Capex of approximately ₹50 crores was incurred in FY24 for debottlenecking cGMP-3, establishing dedicated hydrogenation capability, and augmenting ETP.
*   Outlook: Strategic focus on increasing the share of commercial and late-phase molecules. A cGMP4 capex of ₹288 crores (Phase 1 outlay of ₹160 crores, expected commissioning by end of CY2025) is underway to support the European CDMO MSA and augment capacity.

## Strategic Initiatives and Capital Expenditure

NFIL is pursuing capacity-led growth with significant capex investments:

*   **New HF Plant (Dahej, NFASL):** ₹450 crores investment for a 40,000 TPA capacity, expected to be operational in early 2025. This aims to cater to increasing demand from emerging sectors like renewables and EV markets and provide backward integration.
*   **R32 Capacity Expansion:** Additional ₹84 crores capex for expanding R32 capacity by 4,500 MT, slated for commissioning by February 2025.
*   **cGMP4 Capex (CDMO):** ₹288 crores allocated, with Phase 1 outlay of ₹160 crores to support the MSA with a European CDMO, expected to be commissioned by the end of CY2025.
*   **Agro Specialty Plant (Dahej):** Investment of ₹540 crores, on track for commercial production in Q2 FY25 (as per Board's Report; Chairman's communique mentions early FY25).
*   **R&D and Pilot Centre:** A new R&D and Pilot Centre, alongside a Process Safety Lab, was commissioned to facilitate testing of new molecules.
