## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis dissects Shilchar Technologies Limited's annual report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance:**

FY24 was a record year for Shilchar, showcasing significant growth across key metrics:

* **Revenue:** ₹396.88 Crores (42% YoY growth), exceeding ₹280.24 Crores in FY23.  This strong growth is attributed to 100% utilization of existing capacity and a conducive pricing environment.
* **EBITDA (excluding Other Income):** ₹113.30 Crores (113% YoY growth), up from ₹53.08 Crores in FY23. This reflects improved operating use from higher capacity utilization and a favorable product mix.  The EBITDA margin expanded impressively from 19% to 29%.
* **Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹91.89 Crores (113% YoY growth), a substantial increase from ₹43.12 Crores in FY23.
* **Dividend:** The board recommended a final dividend of ₹12.5 per share (125%), subject to shareholder approval, significantly higher than the previous year's ₹10.

**Key Financial Ratios Analysis:**

The report provides many key financial ratios, indicating strong profitability and liquidity but some concerns about capital efficiency:

* **High Profitability:**  ROE (55.52%), Net Profit Ratio (23.15%), and ROCE (58.24%) all demonstrate strong profitability.

## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on Shilchar Technologies Limited's Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024:

* **Cash flow from operating activities:** ₹764.80 Crores
* **Cash flow from investing activities:** ₹(226.28) Crores (negative indicates net cash outflow)
* **Cash flow from financing activities:** ₹(289.94) Crores (negative indicates net cash outflow)

**Important Note:**  All figures are in Indian Rupees (₹) and are rounded to the nearest Lakh (100,000).  There might be minor discrepancies due to rounding differences in the original report.

### Cash Flow Metrics
To calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF), we need to make some assumptions and deductions based on the provided information, as the annual report doesn't directly state FCF.  A common calculation is:

FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure - Dividends Paid

Based on Shilchar Technologies Limited's Statement of Cash Flows and other information from the report:

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹764.80 Crores
* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** ₹101.99 Crores + ₹1,346.82 Crores = ₹1,448.81 Crores (this includes capital expenditure on property, plant, and equipment and net purchases of investments)
* **Dividends Paid:** ₹38.14 Crores ( this is based on the dividend mentioned in the report, which was to be paid but is not reflected as paid in the cash flow statement. )

Therefore, a *rough estimate* of Free Cash Flow would be:

FCF ≈ ₹764.80 Crores - ₹1,448.81 Crores - ₹38.14 Crores = ₹(722.15) Crores

**Important Note:**  This is an approximation.  A more precise FCF calculation might require additional information from the complete financial statement notes, such as adjustments for changes in working capital, and other potential cash inflows/outflows not explicitly detailed in the provided summary.  Also, the calculation assumes that the mentioned dividend was paid in the year. The cash flow statement provided does not reflect this, warranting further investigation.  The negative FCF suggests the company reinvested heavily in the business during the year.

### Profitability Ratios
To calculate these profitability ratios for Shilchar Technologies Limited, we'll use the figures derived from our previous analysis of the financial statements.  Remember, these are approximations due to rounding in the original report.  All figures are expressed as percentages.


* **Gross Margin:** (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100  = (₹1104.98 Crores / ₹3968.78 Crores) * 100 ≈ 27.8%

* **Operating Margin:** (Operating Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹1132.47 Crores / ₹3968.78 Crores) * 100 ≈ 28.5%

* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100 = (₹918.88 Crores / ₹3968.78 Crores) * 100 ≈ 23.2%

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100 = (₹918.88 Crores / ₹1655.15 Crores) * 100 ≈ 55.5%  *(Average Shareholders' Equity is calculated as (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity)/2)*

* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100 = (₹918.88 Crores / ₹2065.79 Crores) * 100 ≈ 44.5% *(Average Total Assets is calculated as (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets)/2)*

**Important Note:** These are approximate calculations based on the summarized financial data.  Slight variations might occur depending on the precise figures used from the full financial statements and how certain items are classified.  The average equity and asset values used in the ROE and ROA calculations are also approximations.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate these liquidity ratios for Shilchar Technologies Limited, we will use the figures previously derived from the financial statements.  Remember, these are approximations due to rounding in the original report.  All ratios are expressed in times (x).

First, we need to calculate some intermediate values:


* **Current Assets:** ₹2,439.15 Crores
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹795.66 Crores
* **Quick Assets:** Current Assets - Inventories = ₹2,439.15 Crores - ₹595.60 Crores = ₹1,843.55 Crores


Now, we can calculate the liquidity ratios:

* **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹2,439.15 Crores / ₹795.66 Crores ≈ 3.1 times

* **Quick Ratio:** Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = ₹1,843.55 Crores / ₹795.66 Crores ≈ 2.3 times

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities = ₹334.55 Crores / ₹795.66 Crores ≈ 0.4 times


**Important Note:** These are approximate calculations based on the summarized financial data.  Slight variations might occur depending on the precise figures used from the full financial statements and how certain items are classified.  The Current Assets figure includes inventories which some analysts might not include when performing these calculations.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating efficiency ratios for Shilchar Technologies Limited requires using figures derived from our previous analyses, keeping in mind that these are approximations due to rounding in the original report.  All turnover ratios are expressed in times (x), while Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is in days.


* **Asset Turnover:**  Revenue / Average Total Assets.  We need the beginning-of-year total assets to calculate the average, which is not explicitly provided in the summary.  Therefore, this ratio cannot be accurately computed with the available data.

* **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.

    * Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)  is estimated at ₹2,863.80 Crores (from the previous analysis).
    * Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2.  We need the beginning inventory which is not explicitly stated, so this calculation is also approximate.  Let's assume a beginning inventory of ₹231.22 Crores (from the prior year's data).

    * Average Inventory ≈ (₹595.60 Crores + ₹231.22 Crores) / 2 ≈ ₹413.41 Crores

    * Inventory Turnover ≈ ₹2,863.80 Crores / ₹413.41 Crores ≈ 6.9 times

* **Receivables Turnover:** Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable. Again, this requires the beginning-of-year receivables which aren't available.  Therefore, a precise calculation is not possible with the summary data.  However, the report provided a Receivables Turnover Ratio (Days) of 4.27 which implies a turnover of approximately 85 times for FY24

**Important Note:** These are approximate calculations based on the summarized financial data. Significant variations might occur depending on the precise figures used from the complete financial statements and how certain items are classified.  The reliance on estimates for beginning-of-year values for inventory and receivables introduces uncertainty into these calculations. The days sales outstanding given in the report is more accurate as the full calculations aren't provided in the summary.

### Leverage Ratios
Calculating use ratios for Shilchar Technologies Limited presents some challenges due to the limited information provided in the report summary.  Specifically, the report's summary does not detail the full breakdown of debt (short-term and long-term).   We will use the information available, understanding that the results are approximations and potentially less precise than if we had the complete financial statement notes.

* **Debt to Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity.  The report states that the company is debt-free; thus, Total Debt is assumed to be 0.

    * Debt to Equity Ratio = 0 / ₹2,095.83 Crores = 0

* **Debt to Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets.  Again, assuming Total Debt = 0:

    * Debt to Assets Ratio = 0 / ₹2,924.84 Crores = 0

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.

    * EBIT ≈ ₹1,235.34 Crores (from previous analysis)
    * Interest Expense ≈ ₹0.21 Crores (this is the interest expense reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss)

    * Interest Coverage Ratio ≈ ₹1,235.34 Crores / ₹0.21 Crores ≈ 5,882.6 times

**Important Note:** These calculations assume a debt-free status for the company (based on report summary).  This may not be completely accurate; further investigation into the detailed notes accompanying the financial statements is necessary to confirm this assumption.  The interest expense might also be slightly different depending on the precision of the information provided in the Statement of Profit & Loss





## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
Several of these market-based ratios require information not provided in the annual report itself, such as the current market price per share and the total number of outstanding shares.  Therefore, I cannot calculate the Market Cap, P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, and Dividend Yield.  These require real-time market data.

However, we *can* approximate the **Dividend Payout Ratio**:


* **Dividend Payout Ratio:**  (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100.  The annual report states a recommended dividend of ₹12.5 per share, subject to shareholder approval.   Assuming this dividend was approved and paid (which is not reflected in the cash flow summary, so this is a potential area for error in this calculation), and using the number of outstanding shares as 7,626,800 (from the notes):


    * Total Dividends Paid (estimate) = ₹12.5/share * 7,626,800 shares = ₹953.35 Lakhs = ₹9.53 Crores
    * Net Income = ₹918.88 Crores

    * Dividend Payout Ratio (estimate) ≈ (₹9.53 Crores / ₹918.88 Crores) * 100 ≈ 1.04%


**Important Note:** This dividend payout ratio is a *rough estimate* based on the *assumption* that the proposed dividend was actually paid out.  The cash flow statement does not explicitly show this.  To get accurate values for Market Cap, P/E, P/B, and Dividend Yield, you would need to obtain the current market price per share and use the reported net income and book value per share from the report.

* **Committees:**  It outlines the roles and functions of the Audit Committee, Nomination & Remuneration Committee, and Stakeholders Relationship Committee.
* **Policies:**  The company highlights policies relating to Code of Conduct, Whistleblower Mechanism, related party transactions, conflict of interest, and corporate social responsibility.
* **Compliance:**  The report states compliance with various regulations and standards related to corporate governance.

**V. Sustainability Goals:**

The report doesn't explicitly state specific, quantifiable sustainability goals with timelines.  While it mentions various initiatives towards environmental and social responsibility, it lacks a formal, articulated sustainability strategy with clear targets and measurable objectives.  The commitment to reducing carbon footprint through renewable energy sources is a significant element of their environmental strategy but lacks specific targets, progress metrics, or timelines.  A more holistic sustainability strategy with defined targets, regular progress reviews, and robust reporting would be needed for a clear picture.


**Overall:** Shilchar's annual report shows a commitment to ESG principles but needs improvement in providing more detailed, measurable data across its initiatives.  The lack of specific sustainability goals with timelines limits the assessment of their overall sustainability performance.  Greater transparency and quantification of data are essential for enhanced reporting and stakeholder understanding of their ESG performance.
