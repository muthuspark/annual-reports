## Rajratan Global Wire Ltd. (FY 2023-24) Financial Analysis

### Consolidated Financial Performance Overview

Rajratan Global Wire Ltd. experienced flat revenue growth in FY24 amidst increased competition and declining realisations. While sales tonnage increased, profitability metrics contracted significantly due to market pressures and costs associated with major capacity expansion.

*   **Revenue:** Consolidated revenue from operations decreased marginally by 0.55% YoY to Rs. 89,045 Lakhs in FY24 from Rs. 89,537 Lakhs in FY23. The stagnation, despite a 16% volume increase (104,268 MT vs ~90,000 MT implied), highlights the sharp decline in average realisation per tonne (-13.7% YoY to Rs. 86,151/MT).
*   **Profitability:** EBITDA declined by 21.0% YoY to Rs. 12,767 Lakhs, with the EBITDA margin contracting by 374 basis points to 14.34%. Profit After Tax (PAT) saw a steeper decline of 28.2% YoY to Rs. 7,183 Lakhs. The margin pressure is attributed to increased competition, including imports, and inflationary pressures on inputs.
*   **Capital Efficiency:** Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) decreased significantly from 23.67% in FY23 to 16.30% in FY24. Return on Net Worth (RoNW) also decreased from 22.78% to 14.58%. This reflects lower profitability and the capital deployed for the new Chennai facility.

## Cash Management Analysis of Rajratan Global Wire Ltd. (FY 23-24)

### Cash Flow Analysis (Consolidated - INR Lakhs)

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Net cash generated from operating activities stood at 10,086 in FY24, compared to 15,903 in FY23. The decrease reflects lower profitability (Profit Before Tax decreased from 13,415 to 9,376) despite favorable movements in working capital components like inventories and trade payables, offset partially by an increase in trade receivables.
*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Net cash used in investing activities was 9,915 in FY24, lower than 16,389 used in FY23. The primary component was capital expenditure (Payments for purchase of property, plant and equipment) amounting to 12,042 in FY24 (FY23: 16,591), mainly directed towards the Chennai greenfield project and Thailand capacity enhancements. Interest received provided a minor inflow.
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Net cash used in financing activities was 400 in FY24, compared to cash generation of 2,641 in FY23. Key activities included proceeds from borrowings (9,482), repayment of borrowings (6,490), payment of finance costs (1,482), and dividend payment (1,015). The significant shift from inflow to outflow is mainly due to lower net proceeds from borrowings compared to the previous year.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   The working capital cycle extended marginally to 56 days in FY24 from 55 days in FY23.
*   Receivables days increased to 63 days from 56 days in FY23, attributed to easier terms of trade offered to customers amidst a more challenging market. (Standalone Debtors Turnover Ratio remained stable at 5.75 vs 5.72).
*   Inventory management improved, reflected in a higher Standalone Inventory Turnover Ratio of 7.21 in FY24 versus 6.45 in FY23, indicating faster inventory movement despite market challenges. Consolidated inventory levels decreased from 8,619 Lakhs to 7,205 Lakhs.
*   Trade payables turnover (Standalone) remained stable at 6.63 vs 6.61.
*   Working capital as a percentage of total capital employed decreased slightly to 20% in FY24 from 22% in FY23, demonstrating efficient management despite business pressures. The company aims to moderate working capital outlay by focusing on lower inventory levels (just-in-time approach).

### Capital Expenditure Analysis

*   Consolidated capital expenditure (Payments for PPE) was 12,042 Lakhs in FY24, down from 16,591 Lakhs in FY23 but still significant. Standalone capex was 9,917 Lakhs.
*   The major capex driver was the greenfield bead wire manufacturing facility in Chennai (total project cost Rs. 300 Crore), which added 30,000 TPA capacity (expandable to 60,000 TPA). This facility is strategically located near southern customers, raw material suppliers, and the port for export efficiency. Funding mix was Rs 165 Cr net worth and Rs 135 Cr debt.
*   Capex also included initiatives in Thailand for capacity expansion (reaching 60,000 TPA), operational efficiency (automation like conveyors, cranes), and modernization (digital plating line monitoring).
*   Investment reflects a strategic focus on increasing scale (consolidated capacity reaching 1,80,000 TPA bead wire and 12,000 MTA steel wire post-Chennai phase 1), modernization, and geographic diversification to enhance competitiveness and customer service globally.

### Dividend and Shareholder Returns

*   The Board recommended a final dividend of Rs. 2/- per equity share (face value Rs. 2/-) for FY24, subject to shareholder approval. This results in a total dividend payout of Rs. 1015 Lakhs for the year.
*   The dividend payout for FY24 represents approximately 14.1% of the consolidated Profit After Tax (7183 Lakhs).
*   The company has a Dividend Distribution Policy available on its website.
*   No share buyback activity was mentioned for FY24.

### Debt Service Coverage

*   The Interest Coverage Ratio (Standalone) decreased to 7.55 in FY24 from 11.10 in FY23, reflecting the impact of lower operating profits (PBDIT) relative to interest expenses.
*   Debt/EBITDA ratio (Consolidated) increased to 1.50x in FY24 from 1.04x in FY23, indicating higher leverage relative to earnings, primarily due to increased debt financing for the Chennai expansion coinciding with lower EBITDA.
*   The company repaid Rs. 3074 Lakhs of debt (Standalone) during FY24, demonstrating commitment to deleveraging even during expansion.
*   The average cost of debt (Standalone) increased to 7.69% in FY24 from 6.57% in FY23.
*   Despite increased leverage post-expansion, the company maintained its CRISIL A+ Stable credit rating, underpinning its financial standing and debt servicing capability. The debt structure for the expansion includes patient funds with an 84-month tenure.

### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   The Standalone Current Ratio remained stable at 1.33 in FY24 compared to 1.31 in FY23, indicating adequate short-term liquidity.
*   Consolidated Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were 313 Lakhs, slightly up from 309 Lakhs in FY23. Bank balances other than cash equivalents (including margin money) were 1,607 Lakhs (FY23: 1,298 Lakhs).
*   The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) analysis based on provided turnover days: CCC = Receivables Days + Inventory Days - Payables Days. Using Standalone turnover ratios: Inventory Days = 365 / 7.21 = 50.6 days; Receivables Days = 365 / 5.75 = 63.5 days; Payables Days = 365 / 6.63 = 55.0 days. CCC (Standalone) = 63.5 + 50.6 - 55.0 = 59.1 days. This suggests a manageable cycle, although the increase in receivables days impacts it.
*   The company managed liquidity prudently, drawing only 70% of sanctioned short-term loans on average and funding 55% of the Chennai project via net worth, reducing pressure.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Analysis

*   Consolidated Free Cash Flow (OCF - Capex) was negative at -1956 Lakhs in FY24 (10086 - 12042), compared to a negative FCF of -688 Lakhs in FY23 (15903 - 16591). The negative FCF is primarily due to the significant capital expenditure undertaken for the Chennai plant exceeding the operating cash flow generated during the year.
*   Standalone Free Cash Flow was also negative at -962 Lakhs in FY24 (8955 - 9917), compared to -1111 Lakhs in FY23 (10181 - 11292).
*   FCF Yield (Consolidated FCF / Market Capitalization) = -1956 / 295005 = -0.66% for FY24.
*   The negative FCF in the last two years reflects the company's heavy investment phase. Management expects improved earnings in the coming years as the new capacity ramps up, which should support debt reduction and potentially lead to positive FCF generation in the medium term.

## Rajratan Global Wire Limited: FY 2023-24 Financial Analysis

### Executive Summary

Rajratan Global Wire Limited faced a challenging FY 2023-24 due to increased competition and declining price realisations, despite achieving volume growth. Consolidated revenue saw a marginal decline, while EBITDA and PAT decreased significantly due to competitive pressures and lower margins. The company completed a major capacity expansion with the commissioning of its Chennai plant, positioning it for future volume growth and export capabilities, albeit coinciding with a market downturn. Key strategic initiatives focus on leveraging this expanded capacity, globalizing sales efforts (US, Europe), enhancing cost competitiveness, and managing increased debt levels incurred for expansion. The outlook remains guarded due to prevailing market oversupply, but the company expresses confidence in its long-term strategy, strengthened manufacturing base, and market positioning in India and Thailand.

### Financial Performance Analysis

#### Profit & Loss

*   **Revenue:** Consolidated revenue from operations decreased marginally by 0.55% to ₹890.45 Cr in FY24 from ₹895.37 Cr in FY23. This was despite a 15.2% increase in sales tonnage (103,358 MT vs 89,694 MT), indicating significant pressure on realisations (Average Realisation PMT declined 13.7% to ₹86,151 from ₹99,827). Management attributed the revenue performance to increased competition and lower realisation.
*   **EBITDA:** Declined by 21% to ₹127.67 Cr from ₹161.59 Cr in FY23. This was driven by the topline pressure and increased competition impacting profitability.
*   **Profit After Tax (PAT):** Decreased by 28% to ₹71.83 Cr from ₹100.12 Cr in FY23, reflecting the lower operating profit and competitive environment.
*   **Margins:** EBITDA margin contracted by 374 bps to 14.34% (FY24) from 18.08% (FY23). Net Profit margin decreased to 8.07% from 11.18%. This compression is attributed to inflationary pressure on raw materials (though steel prices fluctuated), aggressive imports impacting realisations, and rising competition.
*   **EPS (Basic):** Declined to ₹14.15 from ₹19.72 in FY23.

#### Balance Sheet & Financial Health

*   **Return Ratios:** Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) decreased to 16.30% from 23.67% due to lower profitability and capital employed increasing with the Chennai expansion yet to fully contribute to earnings. Return on Net Worth (RoNW) decreased to 14.58% from 22.78%.
*   **Debt:** Consolidated borrowings (Non-Current + Current) increased to ₹192.67 Cr as of March 31, 2024, from ₹170.97 Cr as of March 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to funding the Chennai expansion (₹135 Cr debt component for the ₹300 Cr project). The Debt-to-Equity ratio remained at 0.39, indicating that the increase in debt was matched by an increase in equity (Net Worth increased to ₹492.60 Cr from ₹439.38 Cr). Debt/EBITDA ratio increased due to lower profitability and higher debt. Management aims to pare down debt over the next two years using earnings.
*   **Liquidity:** Working capital days remained relatively stable at 56 days (FY24) vs 55 days (FY23). The company maintained liquidity despite the large capex, utilizing internal accruals (₹165 Cr) significantly for the Chennai plant funding. Cash and cash equivalents stood at ₹3.13 Cr (Consolidated: ₹12.50 Cr).
*   **Credit Rating:** Maintained CRISIL A+ Stable rating, validating underlying business strength despite current pressures.

#### Cash Flow

*   **Operating Cash Flow:** Cash generated from operations decreased significantly to ₹100.17 Cr (Consolidated) in FY24 from ₹159.96 Cr in FY23, primarily due to lower profitability.
*   **Investing Cash Flow:** Cash outflow from investing activities was ₹99.31 Cr (Consolidated), lower than FY23's ₹165.86 Cr as the major capex on the Chennai plant neared completion.
*   **Financing Cash Flow:** Net cash used in financing activities was ₹4.06 Cr (Consolidated), reflecting debt drawdowns for capex offset by repayments and dividend payouts.

#### Dividend

The Board recommended a final dividend of ₹2 per share, same as FY23, subject to shareholder approval. Total dividend outflow is ₹10.15 Cr.

### Operational & Segment Performance

#### Capacity Expansion

The company commissioned its greenfield Chennai plant (initial 30,000 TPA, expandable to 60,000 TPA). This increases total consolidated capacity to 162,000 TPA (effective FY25) across Indore (72,000 TPA), Chennai (30,000 TPA), and Thailand (60,000 TPA), making it one of Asia's largest bead wire manufacturers (ex-China). The Chennai plant provides strategic port access for exports and proximity to South Indian customers and raw material suppliers, aiming for lower logistics costs and JIT delivery.

#### Volume Growth

Despite market headwinds, sales tonnage grew 15.2% (Consolidated), indicating market share gains or successful offtake from existing customers, albeit at lower prices. The second half of FY24 showed particularly attractive volume growth.

#### Thailand Operations

Rajratan Thai Wire Co. Ltd. (wholly-owned subsidiary) reported a 43% increase in sales volume to 42,211 MT. Net revenues grew by 12%. However, PAT decreased significantly to THB 714.08 Lakhs from THB 1,242.76 Lakhs in FY23, reflecting margin pressures. The focus for FY25 is value-addition and achieving full capacity utilization (target 50,000 tonnes). Digital plating line monitoring was commissioned.

#### Technology & Efficiency

The company implemented digitalisation initiatives (ConnectFacts program) for shop-floor organization, real-time monitoring, and achieving a nearly paperless environment, saving significant person-hours. TPM practices were implemented in Thailand. Investments were made in R&D, including the Rajratan Excellence Centre.

### Key Audit Matters (KAMs)

The Independent Auditors identified the following KAMs for the consolidated financial statements:

*   **Capitalisation and useful life of property, plant and equipment (PPE):** Due to significant capex incurred (Chennai plant, expansions), judgment involved in assessing costs eligible for capitalization (including borrowing costs) under Ind AS 16, and determining useful lives. Auditors tested controls, performed substantive testing on capitalised costs, verified borrowing cost calculations, and examined management's assessment of useful
