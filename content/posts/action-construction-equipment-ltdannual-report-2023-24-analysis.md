## Financial Analysis Report: Action Construction Equipment Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The Independent Auditor, B S R & Co. LLP, issued an unmodified opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. This signifies that the financial statements present a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.

#### Standalone Financial Statements

The auditor's report includes an "Other Matter" paragraph stating that their opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts and disclosures for Action Construction Equipment Limited Employees Welfare Trust, is based solely on the report of another independent auditor.

#### Consolidated Financial Statements

The auditor's report includes an "Other Matter" paragraph indicating reliance on reports of other independent auditors for one subsidiary and one employee welfare trust. Additionally, the financial statements of two subsidiaries, whose financial information is deemed not material to the Group, were unaudited and based on management-certified information.

No qualifications were made on the financial statements themselves. However, under "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" (Rule 11(g) of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014), the auditor noted for both standalone and consolidated reports that while the company uses accounting software, the feature of recording an audit trail (edit log) facility has not been enabled. This is a compliance deficiency.

#### Key Audit Matters (KAMs)

For both standalone and consolidated statements, "Revenue recognition relating to sale of products" was identified as a Key Audit Matter due to the inherent risk of misstatement and its significance as a key performance indicator.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets, liabilities, and plan assets measured at fair value, in accordance with Ind AS. Key accounting policies consistently applied include:

*   Revenue Recognition: Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control to customers. Revenue from services is recognized as rendered.
*   Inventories: Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value.
*   Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE): Measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.
*   Intangible Assets: Recorded at cost less accumulated amortization (straight-line) and impairment.
*   Financial Instruments: Classified and measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) based on business model and cash flow characteristics. Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied for impairment.
*   Leases: Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for leases, with exemptions for short-term and low-value leases.
*   Impairment: Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment indicators at each reporting date. Financial assets are assessed for ECL.
*   Employee Benefits: Include short-term benefits, defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans (actuarially valued), and share-based payments (fair valued at grant date).
*   Income Tax: Current tax is based on taxable income; deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences.

#### Changes in Accounting Policies

No material changes in accounting policies were reported for FY 2023-24. The company applied existing policies consistently. Notes to the financial statements (Standalone: 1.2.v; Consolidated: 1.3.v) indicate that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) did not notify any new standards or amendments applicable to the company/group for FY 2023-24.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

#### Management's Assertion

The Board's Report and Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) state that the company has adequate internal control systems and procedures commensurate with its size and operations, designed to ensure reliability in financial reporting, safeguarding of assets, and legal compliance. The Directors' Responsibility Statement confirms adequate internal financial controls are in place and operating effectively.

#### Auditor's Assessment

The Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Financial Controls (Annexure B to the main audit report) opines that the company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, and such controls were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024.

#### Identified Weakness

A significant control deficiency was highlighted by the auditors: the accounting software used by the company did not have the audit trail (edit log) facility enabled. This impacts the verifiability and integrity of accounting records and is a non-compliance with Rule 3(1) of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

#### Secretarial Audit

The Secretarial Audit Report (Form MR-3) for FY 2023-24, issued by Vasisht & Associates, Company Secretaries, states that the company has complied with applicable statutory provisions (Companies Act, SCRA, Depositories Act, FEMA, SEBI Regulations, specific labour and environmental laws) and has proper Board processes and compliance mechanisms. The report contains no qualifications, reservations, or adverse remarks.

#### Secretarial Compliance Report

The Annual Secretarial Compliance Report further confirms compliance with all applicable SEBI Regulations and circulars/guidelines.

#### Corporate Governance

The Corporate Governance Report details compliance with SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. The company has affirmed compliance with its Code of Conduct.

#### Audit Trail Non-Compliance

As noted above, the failure to enable the audit trail (edit log) feature in the accounting software represents a non-compliance with specific provisions of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014. This is a regulatory lapse requiring remediation.

#### Statutory Dues

The auditor's report (CARO) indicates that undisputed statutory dues have generally been regularly deposited, though some delays were noted for Income-Tax. Disputed statutory dues primarily relate to GST, Income Tax, Excise Duty, and VAT, pending at various appellate forums.

### Legal Proceedings and their Potential Impact

#### Contingent Liabilities

Note 34 to the Standalone Financial Statements and Note 35 to the Consolidated Financial Statements detail claims against the company not acknowledged as debts. These primarily consist of:

*   Tax-related matters: Disputes concerning Income Tax (disallowances of deductions/expenses), Central Excise (classification disputes, CENVAT credit), Service Tax (export of services rules), Goods and Services Tax (transition of input tax credit), and West Bengal Value Added Tax (rate/classification disputes). The total disputed tax amount is approximately ₹367.80 lakhs (Standalone) and ₹374.78 lakhs (Consolidated).
*   Other matters: Claims related to employees/ex-employees and customers amounting to ₹100 lakhs (Standalone) and ₹1,088.37 lakhs (Consolidated).

#### Management and Auditor Assessment

The company management and auditors state that pending resolution, it is not practicable to estimate the timings of cash outflows, and they do not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on the company's/group's financial position.

#### Significant Orders

The Board's Report states there were no significant and material orders passed by regulators, courts, or tribunals impacting the going concern status and company's operations in the future.

### Related Party Transactions (RPTs)

All transactions with related parties during FY 2023-24 are reported to have been conducted on an arm's length basis and in the ordinary course of business. These transactions were approved by the Audit Committee. Form AOC-2 (Annexure V to Board's Report) confirms that no contracts or arrangements were entered into with related parties that were not at arm's length, and no material RPTs (as defined by SEBI LODR and the company's policy) were entered into.
