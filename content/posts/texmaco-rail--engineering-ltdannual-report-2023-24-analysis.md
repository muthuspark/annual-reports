Texmaco Rail & Engineering Limited reported a significant improvement in its financial performance for FY24 compared to FY23.

*   **Revenue from Operations:** Increased to ₹3,50,287.01 lakhs in FY24 from ₹2,24,327.74 lakhs in FY23, a growth of approximately 56.15%.
*   **Profitability:**
    *   **Operating Profit (PBIDT):** Stood at ₹28,952 lakhs in FY24, a substantial increase from ₹13,938 lakhs in FY23.

    *   **Operating Profit Margin (Standalone):** Increased to 8.27% (PBIDT/Revenue) in FY24 from 6.21% in FY23.

    *   **Basic EPS:** Increased to ₹3.27 in FY24 from ₹0.61 in FY23.

*   **Dividend:** The Board has recommended a dividend of 50% (₹0.50 per equity share of ₹1 each) for FY24, a significant increase from 15% (₹0.15 per equity share) in FY23.
*   **Return on Equity (Standalone):** Improved to 5.88% in FY24 from 1.48% in FY23.

**Analysis:** The financial performance in FY24 demonstrates a strong recovery and growth phase for the Company.

The significant reduction in the debt-equity ratio points to a strengthened balance sheet.

*   **Credit Rating:** Upgraded from 'CARE BBB+' to 'CARE A-' by CARE Ratings.

    *   Emphasis on increasing modal share of rail in freight.
    *   Announcement of three major economic railway corridor programs.
*   **Company Positioning:**
    *   Well-positioned to capitalize on railway capex and wagon ordering.
    *   Strong focus on exports.
    *   Leveraging R&D for next-generation freight cars and components.

**Analysis:** The strong government focus on railway infrastructure development and increasing freight movement by rail provides a very favorable long-term outlook for the Company. Texmaco appears well-equipped to benefit from these trends, both domestically and in export markets.

### Key Risks and Mitigants

*   **Management Identified Risks (MD&A):**
    *   **Volatility and working capital requirements of EPC business:** Being addressed by the proposed demerger of the Infra Rail & Green Energy Division.
    *   **Execution Risk in Large Orders:** Managing very large orders requires robust execution capabilities.
*   **Key Audit Matters (Auditor's Report - Standalone & Consolidated):**
    *   **Revenue Recognition for long-term projects:** Significant judgments are involved in using the percentage of completion method.

**Analysis:** The demerger strategy mitigates a key business risk. Revenue recognition in long-term contracts and contingent liabilities from tax disputes remain areas requiring careful monitoring and management judgment.

*   **Standalone Financial Statements:** L. B. Jha & Co. issued an unqualified opinion, stating that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the Company's state of affairs as of March 31, 2024, and its profit, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Consolidated Financial Statements:** L. B. Jha & Co. also issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements, stating that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its consolidated profit, consolidated changes in equity, and its consolidated cash flows. The audit of one subsidiary and two jointly controlled entities was conducted by other auditors, and the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, insofar as it relates to these entities, is based solely on the reports of such other auditors.
*   **Key Audit Matters (KAMs):**
    *   **Revenue Recognition for long-term projects:** Significant judgments are required regarding progress, costs to complete, and potential onerous obligations due to the nature of long-term engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts and the use of the percentage of completion method.
    *   **Contingent Liabilities (Tax Litigations):** Assessing the probability of economic outflow and determining provisions or disclosures under Ind AS 37 involves significant management judgment due to significant pending tax litigations (₹20,582.07 lakhs as per consolidated KAM disclosure).

### Key Accounting Policies

*   **Basis of Accounting:** Financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans measured at fair value. The functional currency is Indian Rupees. The operating cycle is ascertained as 12 months.
*   **Revenue Recognition:**
    *   Sale of Goods: Recognized when significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, and the amount can be reliably measured.
    *   Construction Contracts (Ind AS 115): Recognized over time by measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligation, based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date to total estimated cost. This involves significant judgment. Variable consideration is included when reasonably estimable and reversal is improbable.
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE):** Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis as per Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, except for certain assets where useful life is based on technical expert reports. Assets costing ₹5,000 or less are fully depreciated in the year of addition.
*   **Intangible Assets:** Recorded at cost less accumulated amortization (Straight Line Basis, generally over 6 years).
*   **Financial Instruments:** Recognized at fair value on initial recognition. Subsequently measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) based on classification. Impairment is assessed based on Expected Credit Losses.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average basis) and net realizable value.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use assets are recognized at the commencement date and depreciated. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments.
*   **Employee Benefits:** Defined contribution plans (e.g., Provident Fund) are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (e.g., Gratuity) are accounted for based on actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method, with remeasurements recognized in OCI.
*   **Taxation:** Current tax is based on taxable profit. Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach for temporary differences. MAT credit is recognized as a deferred tax asset.
*   **Changes in Accounting Policies:** No significant changes in accounting policies due to new mandatory standards in FY24. Policies appear to be consistently applied.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   **Auditor's Report on Internal Financial Controls (IFC):**
    *   **Standalone:** L. B. Jha & Co. opined that the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting, and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024.
    *   **Consolidated:** A similar unqualified opinion was issued for the Group, its subsidiary companies, and jointly controlled entities incorporated in India, based on their audit and reports of other auditors for certain entities.
*   **Specific Observation by Auditors (Rule 11(g) of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 for Standalone, and Rule 11(vi) for Consolidated):**
    *   The Company (and its Indian subsidiaries/JVs) used accounting software that, for the Holding Company and most subsidiaries/JVs, did not have a feature of recording an audit trail (edit log) facility. However, the auditors noted management's representation that the software does not allow editing or deletion of transactions, thus transactions cannot be tampered with.
    *   One jointly controlled entity's auditor (not L.B. Jha & Co.) reported that while their software had an audit trail feature, it was not enabled/operated for a brief period (April 1, 2023, to April 10, 2023).
    *   The auditors state that reporting on the preservation of audit trail as per statutory requirements is not applicable for FY ended March 31, 2024, as the proviso to Rule 3(1) of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 is applicable from April 1, 2023.
*   **Management Responsibility:** The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate IFC.
*   **Audit Committee Review:** The Audit Committee periodically reviews the internal control system.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **General Compliance:** The Secretarial Audit Report confirms that the Company has generally complied with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, SCRA, Depositories Act, FEMA (to the extent applicable), SEBI regulations (including Takeover Code, Insider Trading, ICDR), and other specific laws like the Factories Act and Environment Protection Act. Compliance with Secretarial Standards and SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) is also affirmed.
*   **Past Non-compliance:** The Corporate Governance report mentions a fine levied by BSE & NSE for a delay in the appointment of Independent Directors during FY21 due to COVID-19.
