### Executive Summary

Camlin Fine Sciences Limited (CFS) reported a challenging financial year 2023-24, marked by a significant decline in profitability on both standalone and consolidated bases.

#### Key Financial Ratios (Standalone Basis)

| Ratio                               | FY 2023-24 | FY 2022-23 | % Change   | Reason for Change                                   |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Interest Service Coverage Ratio     | (0.06)     | 0.23       | -360.87%   | Loss incurred during the year                       |
| Debt Equity Ratio                   | 0.36       | 0.48       | -25.00%    | Conversion of FCCBs, reducing outstanding debt      |
| Operating Profit Margin (%)         | (6.49)%    | 8.01%      | -181.02%   | Loss incurred during the year                       |

The ratios reflect severe stress on profitability and debt servicing capacity at the standalone level in FY24. The reduction in Debt Equity Ratio is a positive outcome of FCCB conversion.

#### Profitability Analysis

FY24 saw a significant erosion in profitability. Consolidated gross margins were impacted by global weak demand, predatory pricing by Chinese manufacturers in performance chemicals and aroma products. The temporary shutdown of the Diphenol Plant in CFS Europe SpA adversely affected revenue and EBITDA margins. While shelf-life solutions products showed volume improvement, pricing headwinds impacted gross margins. Delays in stabilization and lower capacity utilization of the Vanillin plant in Dahej also contributed to margin pressure and losses. Impairment provisions further deepened the net loss.

#### Liquidity and Solvency

The company managed liquidity through efficient working capital and debt maturity management.

*   **Standalone Borrowings:**
    *   Short-term: Increased to ₹23,336.38 lakh (FY24) from ₹21,968.21 lakh (FY23).
    *   Long-term: Decreased to ₹25,826.01 lakh (FY24) from ₹38,465.71 lakh (FY23), mainly due to FCCB conversion.
*   **Consolidated Borrowings:**
    *   Short-term: Stood at ₹23,346.16 lakh (FY24) compared to ₹23,328.35 lakh (FY23).
    *   Long-term: Stood at ₹42,419.60 lakh (FY24) compared to ₹54,630.28 lakh (FY23), also reflecting FCCB conversion.
*   **Credit Ratings (India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd.):**
    *   Term loan: IND A-/Stable
    *   Fund-based limits: IND A-/Stable/IND A2+
    *   Non-fund-based limits: IND A2+
    *   Long Term Issuer Rating: IND A-/Stable (affirmed)

Equity share capital increased due to ESOP allotment and conversion of ₹102.59 crore worth of FCCBs by IFC into 1,02,58,986 equity shares. No dividend was recommended for FY24 due to losses.

### Business Segment Performance

The company operates primarily in one reportable segment: Speciality Chemicals.

#### Shelf-Life Solutions

*   **North America:** Exponential growth, particularly in pet food. Natural blends were a focus. New customer acquisitions and distributor partnerships strengthened market base. Expected to grow significantly.
*   **Asia Pacific:** Volume growth but reduced realization due to competition. Renewed focus on pet food in key countries.
*   **Mexico (Dresen Quimica):** Revenues stable despite challenging environment. Margins affected by international competition and lower market.

## Cash Flow Analysis: Camlin Fine Sciences Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Cash Flow Analysis (Consolidated - FY 2023-24 vs FY 2022-23, ₹ in Lakh)

#### Cash Flow from Operating Activities (OCF)

*   FY 2023-24: ₹13,980.77 lakh
*   FY 2022-23: ₹5,189.40 lakh

##### Key Components & Drivers (FY 2023-24)

*   (Loss)/Profit Before Tax: (₹9,023.16 lakh)
*   Adjustments for non-cash/non-operating items:
    *   Depreciation & Amortization: ₹7,901.67 lakh
    *   Finance Costs: ₹6,926.14 lakh
    *   Provision for impairment in assets: ₹4,980.40 lakh
    *   Revaluation of inventory: ₹3,681.08 lakh
    *   Foreign exchange loss (unrealised): ₹3,073.88 lakh
*   Operating Profit before Working Capital Changes: ₹15,706.45 lakh
*   Working Capital Adjustments:
    *   (Increase)/Decrease in Financial Liabilities (Net): ₹(807.28) lakh
    *   (Increase)/Decrease in Non-financial Assets (Net): ₹1,912.50 lakh
    *   (Increase)/Decrease in Financial Assets (Net): ₹3,982.10 lakh
*   Cash Generated from Operations: ₹18,788.95 lakh
*   Taxes Paid (Net): (₹4,808.18 lakh)

##### Analysis

OCF improved significantly in FY24 despite a pre-tax loss, primarily driven by large positive working capital changes (decrease in financial assets and non-financial assets, and increase in financial liabilities) and substantial non-cash charges like impairment and inventory revaluation being added back.

#### Cash Flow from Investing Activities (ICF)

*   FY 2023-24: (₹6,087.38 lakh)
*   FY 2022-23: (₹12,659.37 lakh)

##### Key Components (FY 2023-24)

*   Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment: (₹6,221.95 lakh)
*   Interest Received: ₹332.36 lakh

##### Analysis

ICF outflow reduced in FY24, mainly due to significantly lower purchases of PPE compared to FY23.

#### Cash Flow from Financing Activities (FCF)

*   FY 2023-24: (₹8,960.65 lakh)
*   FY 2022-23: ₹5,780.28 lakh

##### Key Components (FY 2023-24)

*   Proceeds from Issue of Equity Shares (ESOP): ₹58.04 lakh
*   Proceeds from/(Repayment of) Long-term Borrowings (Net): ₹2,071.54 lakh
*   Proceeds from/(Repayment of) Short-term Borrowings (Net): (₹599.23 lakh)
*   Payment of Lease Liabilities: (₹1,810.79 lakh)
*   Interest Paid: (₹7,017.73 lakh)
*   Payment of Preferred Dividend: (₹2,063.07 lakh) (to NCI of a subsidiary)

##### Analysis

FY24 saw a significant net outflow from financing activities, driven by substantial interest payments, repayment of lease liabilities, and preferred dividend payouts, despite some proceeds from long-term borrowings. This contrasts with a net inflow in FY23 which was supported by higher proceeds from borrowings.

#### Free Cash Flow (FCF = OCF - Capex)

##### Consolidated Capex (Purchase of PPE from ICF)

*   FY 2023-24: ₹6,221.95 lakh
*   FY 2022-23: ₹14,133.77 lakh

##### Consolidated FCF

*   FY 2023-24: ₹13,980.77 lakh - ₹6,221.95 lakh = ₹7,758.82 lakh
*   FY 2022-23: ₹5,189.40 lakh - ₹14,133.77 lakh = (₹8,944.37 lakh)

##### Analysis

The company generated positive FCF in FY24 after a negative FCF in FY23. This improvement is due to both higher OCF and lower capex in FY24.

### Working Capital Management Efficiency

*   **Management Commentary:** The Director's Report (FY24) acknowledges a "challenging year for financing and liquidity" but states the company maneuvered through "efficient working capital and debt maturity management."

#### Standalone Ratios (from Annual Report Notes)

*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY24: 1.83 times (Previous: 2.18 times).
    *   Decrease indicates slower inventory movement.
    *   Reason cited: Loss incurred during the year impacting COGS.
*   **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY24: 1.56 times (Previous: 1.49 times).
    *   Slight improvement.
*   **Trade Payables Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY24: 1.73 times (Previous: 2.05 times).
    *   Decrease indicates slower payment to suppliers.
    *   Reason cited: Increase in average trade payables.
*   **Net Working Capital Turnover Ratio:**
    *   FY24: 2.88 times (Previous: 2.17 times).
    *   Improvement.

#### Consolidated Working Capital (Changes noted in OCF)

A significant positive impact on OCF in FY24 from working capital changes implies an inflow from reduction in current assets or increase in current liabilities. This includes:

*   Decrease in Inventories: (Contributed to positive OCF in "Changes in Inventories...")
*   Decrease in Trade Receivables: (Implied by positive adjustment for "Financial Assets" in OCF)
*   Increase in Trade Payables: (Implied by positive adjustment for "Financial Liabilities" in OCF)

#### Analysis

While standalone turnover ratios show mixed efficiency (slower inventory and payable turnover, slightly better receivable turnover), the consolidated cash flow indicates an overall net release of cash from working capital in FY24, aiding liquidity.

## Camlin Fine Sciences Limited (CFSL) - FY 2023-24 Financial Analysis

### Revenue and Profitability Analysis

CFSL reported a decline in consolidated revenue from operations to ₹161,306.20 lakh in FY24 from ₹1,68,156.40 lakh in FY23. The company experienced a significant shift from a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹3,981.04 lakh in FY23 to a loss after tax & exceptional items of ₹10,487.51 lakh in FY24. Consolidated EBITDA also saw a sharp decrease to ₹11,169.45 lakh from ₹21,830.16 lakh.

Standalone revenue from operations marginally decreased to ₹77,326.21 lakh in FY24 from ₹78,943.57 lakh in FY23. Standalone operations also moved to a loss after tax of ₹5,138.92 lakh from a PAT of ₹4,755.47 lakh. Standalone EBITDA fell drastically to ₹2,757.70 lakh from ₹12,792.23 lakh.

#### Key Drags on Profitability:

*   Global weak demand and predatory pricing by Chinese manufacturers significantly impacted performance chemicals and aroma products.
*   Temporary shutdown of the Diphenol Plant in CFS Europe SpA, Italy, reduced revenue and gross margins, adversely affecting EBITDA.
*   Despite volume improvements in shelf-life solutions, pricing headwinds severely impacted gross margins.
*   Delayed stabilization and lower capacity utilization of the Vanillin manufacturing plant in Dahej negatively affected revenues and profitability.
*   Consolidated results were further impacted by impairment provisions of ₹4,980.40 lakh for subsidiaries in Europe and China.
*   Standalone Interest Service Coverage Ratio declined by 74.17% due to losses. Operating Profit Margin and Net Profit Margin (standalone) declined by 61.10% and 210.32% respectively. Return on Net Worth (standalone) fell by 65.81%.

### Market Share and Competitive Position

The company faces intense competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers employing predatory pricing strategies in performance chemicals and aroma ingredients. The Shelf-Life Solutions business in North America benefited from a strategic partnership with a leading distributor, strengthening its market position against competitors using China-sourced materials. The "NaSure" natural antioxidant portfolio is identified as a cornerstone of success, reflecting a commitment to quality and sustainability. CFS Dresen (Mexico) is positioned as a leading supplier in Animal Nutrition and Food sectors in Latin America. The Aroma sector globally experienced challenging conditions, with CFSL mirroring these trends but anticipating a turnaround.

### Key Products/Services Performance

#### Shelf-Life Solutions:

*   **North America:** Showed exponential growth, with pet food contributing over half of the segment's annual revenue. Focus on natural blends, new customer acquisition, and distributor partnerships drove performance. Strong future growth is anticipated.
*   **Asia Pacific:** Achieved volume growth but experienced reduced realizations due to competition. A renewed focus on the pet food segment is underway.
*   **Latin America (CFS Dresen & South America):** Mexico revenues remained stable despite challenges. South America showed respectable growth in revenue and profitability post-restructuring, with antioxidant and animal nutrition businesses performing well. Biodiesel in Brazil performed exceptionally, while the Argentina biodiesel vertical was shut down.

#### Performance Chemicals:

Suffered from depressed global consumer demand, leading to reduced operating capacities. Chinese low-pricing strategy impacted the market. CFSL maintained sales volumes and customer retention. New approvals in the USA and Europe are expected to drive future business. CFS Europe SpA was severely affected by the diphenol market slowdown, halting diphenol production. The company is evaluating plant reconversion for alternative performance chemicals.

#### Aroma Ingredients:

The launch of Vanillin and Ethyl Vanillin faced challenges from lower global demand and aggressive Chinese pricing. Partnerships with F&B distributors and positive responses from F&F companies are improving outlook. Focus is on delivering high-quality products and gaining domestic market share.

#### Health & Wellness (AlgalR Nutrapharms):

Improved production processes for Algal DHA Oil yielded superior results and enabled the launch of higher-grade products. Increased demand for algal DHA biomass in the feed industry due to the crude fish oil availability crisis. The company is strategically positioned for geographic expansion and market penetration.

### Geographic Distribution and Market Penetration

*   **North America:** Strong growth in Shelf-Life Solutions, leveraging new client acquisitions and distributor networks.
*   **Asia Pacific:** Focus on expanding Shelf-Life Solutions

## Risk Profile: Camlin Fine Sciences Limited

#### Control Effectiveness

Internal controls and frameworks (Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee) are in place. ESG initiatives demonstrate a focus on operational sustainability. IT systems are actively managed.

#### Potential Financial Impact

*   CFS Europe SpA Diphenol plant shutdown led to reduced revenue, gross margins, and adverse EBITDA impact. Exceptional item includes impairment provisions for subsidiaries in Europe (CFS Europe inventory write-down of ₹2,279.56 lakh) and China.
*   Costs associated with production inefficiencies or delays.
*   Potential fines or compensation for environmental or safety non-compliance (e.g., NGT matter for Tarapur MIDC, contingent liability of ₹1,712.31 lakh, though stayed and contested).

#### Quantitative Risk Metrics & YoY Changes

*   Energy Consumption (Standalone, Total): 1,252,688 GJ (FY24) vs 1,286,659 GJ (FY23). (Annexure E & BRSR)

Camlin Fine Sciences Limited (CFS) reported a challenging financial year 2023-24, marked by a decline in consolidated revenue and a significant shift from profit to loss. Consolidated revenue from operations stood at ₹161,306.20 lakh, a decrease from ₹1,68,156.40 lakh in FY23. The company incurred a consolidated loss after tax & exceptional items of ₹10,487.51 lakh, compared to a profit of ₹3,981.04 lakh in the previous year. Standalone performance mirrored this trend, with revenue at ₹77,326.21 lakh (FY23: ₹78,943.57 lakh) and a loss after tax of ₹5,138.92 lakh (FY23: profit of ₹4,755.47 lakh). Key factors impacting performance include global weak demand, predatory pricing by Chinese manufacturers, temporary shutdown of the Diphenol plant in Italy, delayed stabilization and lower capacity utilization of the Vanillin plant in Dahej, and impairment provisions amounting to ₹4,980.40 lakh for European and Chinese subsidiaries. Consequently, no dividend has been recommended.

### Revenue and Profitability Analysis

*   **Consolidated Revenue:** Declined by 4.07% YoY to ₹161,306.20 lakh.
*   **Consolidated EBITDA:** Fell to ₹11,067.08 lakh from ₹21,832.37 lakh in FY23, a decrease of 49.31%. This indicates severe pressure on operating margins.
*   **Consolidated (Loss)/Profit Before Tax & Exceptional Items:** Stood at a loss of ₹4,180.31 lakh compared to a profit of ₹9,395.25 lakh in FY23.
*   **Consolidated Exceptional Items:** An expense of ₹4,980.40 lakh was booked, primarily due to impairment provisions.
*   **Consolidated Net (Loss)/Profit After Tax:** ₹(10,487.51) lakh versus ₹3,981.04 lakh in FY23.
*   **Standalone Revenue:** Decreased by 2.05% YoY to ₹77,326.21 lakh.
*   **Standalone EBITDA:** Dropped to ₹2,948.50 lakh from ₹12,846.56 lakh in FY23, a 77.05% decline.
*   **Standalone (Loss)/Profit Before Tax & Exceptional Items:** ₹(5,010.52) lakh compared to a profit of ₹6,492.78 lakh in FY23. An exceptional item (impairment) of ₹192.84 lakh was recorded.
*   **Standalone Net (Loss)/Profit After Tax:** ₹(5,138.92) lakh versus ₹4,755.47 lakh in FY23.

The primary drivers for the decline in revenues and profitability were external market conditions (weak demand, Chinese competition) and internal operational challenges (plant shutdowns, stabilization delays). The Diphenol plant shutdown in CFS Europe SpA particularly impacted revenues and EBITDA margins. While volume improved in shelf-life solutions, pricing headwinds eroded gross margins.

### Segment Performance and Strategic Highlights

The company operates in Shelf-Life Solutions, Aroma Ingredients, Performance Chemicals, and Health & Wellness.

*   **Shelf-Life Solutions:** North America showed exponential growth, driven by pet food and natural blends. Asia Pacific experienced volume growth but lower realization due to competition. Mexico faced margin pressure. South America saw a turnaround due to restructuring. The biodiesel vertical performed well in Brazil.
*   **Performance Chemicals:** Suffered from depressed consumer demand and Chinese predatory pricing. CFS maintained volumes and secured new approvals in the US/Europe. The Diphenol plant (CFS Europe) shutdown significantly impacted this segment; reconversion plans are being evaluated.
*   **Aroma Ingredients:** The launch of Vanillin and Ethyl Vanillin faced challenges from lower global demand and Chinese competition. A partnership with a major F&B distributor is a positive step.
*   **Health & Wellness:** Improved production processes for Algal DHA Oil and launched higher grades. Increased demand for algal DHA biomass in the feed industry due to crude fish oil availability crisis.
*   **Vanillin Plant (Dahej):** Commercialization encountered initial stabilization issues and intense competition. The strategy has been adjusted, with sales commencing at current prices, impacting margins.
