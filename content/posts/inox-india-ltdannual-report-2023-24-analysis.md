Designed, manufactured, and erected 311 M3 Liquid Hydrogen tank in South Korea for mobility application. Kandla SEZ Plant achieved record revenue of ₹335 Crore.

#### LNG Division

*   **Business Environment:** LNG prices stabilized, remaining above historical averages due to limited production capacity. Global LNG demand projected to rise to 625-685 million MT by 2040, driven by coal-to-gas switching in Asia. USA became the largest LNG producer. LNG played a crucial role in European energy security. Domestically, India's LNG imports rose. NITI Aayog report supports LNG for transport, aligning with India's goal of 15% natural gas in energy mix by 2030.
*   **Achievements (Export):** Set new benchmark in Brazil with large fleet of 61 M3 LNG Semi-Trailers for On-Road distribution. Supplied a 560 M3 LNG Marine Fuel Gas Tank (one of the largest from Kandla Works) to a European shipyard for a Japanese cruise vessel.

Won key orders for LCNG Stations and commissioned several for CGD companies. Secured orders for LNG fuel tanks from automobile OEMs as LNG-fueled truck trials completed. Supplied LNG Fuel Tanks for MSRTC's pilot project to convert diesel buses to LNG. Signed Mutual Support Agreement with Adani Total Gas Limited to strengthen LNG ecosystem.

#### Cryoscientific Division

*   **Business Environment:** Growing global focus on renewable energy and nuclear fusion (ITER). Cryogenics (Liquid Helium) vital for superconducting magnets in fusion. Demand for cryo-distribution in atomic acceleration research (Cryolines, Feedboxes, Cryomodules). Defence applications (AIP systems for submarines requiring LOX). Medical applications (MRI machines – India largely imports).
*   **Achievements:** Received challenging project from ITER Organisation for vacuum vessel thermal shield repair work (5 of 9 sectors awarded). Received 2 first orders from Wroclaw University, Poland for FAIR Project, Germany (Feedboxes, Current lead boxes). First order from L&T Defence for LOX tank for AIP system in Kalvari submarines. First order from MTAR Technologies for high-pressure kerosene tank for rocket engine testing. Ongoing ITER Project cryo/warm lines installation (approx. 80% complete, 100% in Cryoplant building). Continuous business from ITER/CERN, including special orders for impregnation chamber (CERN) and Multi Process Cryolines (ITER).

#### Other Businesses

*   **Disposable Refrigerant Cylinders:** Low demand initially due to US anti-dumping case; orders resumed in Q4 FY24 post favorable initial USDOC report. Strong domestic demand. Developed cylinders for new refrigerants (R448A, R410A, etc.) and dual-use DC-30 cylinders for US. Developed helium storage and propane application prototype cylinders. Successfully completed US DOT 39 audit for Silvassa & Kalol.
*   **Stainless Steel Kegs:** COVID-19 recovery delayed by geopolitical situation and inflation. Positive outlook due to balance of profitability/sustainability favoring returnable stainless-steel kegs. Global annual demand estimated between 4.5-7.5 Mio units. Growth expected from emerging markets. Successfully commissioned keg plant at new Savli facility; initial samples well-received in Europe. Dispatched kegs to Belgium, Germany, US for approvals.

## Audit & Compliance

### Audit and Regulatory Analysis

#### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

The Independent Auditors' Reports on both Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, provide an unqualified opinion. The auditors state that the financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India.

*   **Standalone Financial Statements:** No qualifications are noted. A Key Audit Matter (KAM) identified is "Revenue from Contracts recognized over time" due to significant management judgment involved in estimating percentage completion and contract margins based on actual costs incurred and forecasted future costs.
*   **Consolidated Financial Statements:** No qualifications are noted. The same KAM, "Revenue from Contracts recognized over time," is identified. An "Other Matter" paragraph highlights that the financial statements of two foreign subsidiaries, reflecting total assets of ₹5,929.32 lakhs and total revenues of ₹6,442.43 lakhs, were not audited but were certified by management. These are stated as not material to the Group. The auditors' opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

#### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

The company has consistently applied its material accounting policies during the financial year 2023-24. No new standards or amendments notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) were applicable to the company for this financial year that would necessitate a change in accounting policies.

##### Key accounting policies include:

*   **Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):** Revenue from contracts is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. For obligations satisfied over time (a significant portion, particularly for long-term projects), progress is measured using the input method (proportion of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost). This involves significant estimation for total contract costs and revenue.
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) and Intangible Assets:** Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment. The company elected to use previous GAAP carrying amounts as deemed cost on Ind AS transition. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over useful lives prescribed by Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, or based on technical assessment for certain assets.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized for leases. Short-term leases and low-value asset leases are expensed on a straight-line basis.
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average for raw materials, stores & spares; includes material, labor, and overheads for finished goods & WIP) and net realizable value.
