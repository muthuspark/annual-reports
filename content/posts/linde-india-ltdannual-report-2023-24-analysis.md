## Gases, Related Products & Services Segment

### Management Guidance and Assumptions

Management assumes continued high gas & liquid demand across all key sectors, driven by steel, glass, chemicals, and a surge in helium demand. Pricing discipline is a core management assumption. The onsite segment is assumed to face incremental demand from steel customers.

### Market Growth Forecasts

Steel sector growth is expected to continue driving higher gas consumption. The healthcare segment is forecasted to see increased demand for Liquid Medical Oxygen from both private and government hospitals.

### Planned Strategic Initiatives

Focus on building density and sustaining market leadership through application-led gas sales and enhanced service levels. Expansion into the glass/frit and chemical industries in Gujarat. Exploration of innovative operating models to meet steel sector demand in the Eastern Region. Sustained focus on the ophthalmic mixes and solar segments. Installation of multiple Liquid Medical Oxygen installations and 22 Healthcare PSA installations.

### Capital Expenditure Plans

Strategic investment in Zenataris Renewable Energy Private Limited for renewable power procurement was made. Multiple rooftop Solar PV installations across various sites. Investment in expanding footprint in the Healthcare segment.

### Efficiency Improvement Targets

Continued optimization of plant operations to improve specific power consumption, with multiple initiatives to reduce energy consumption and improve profitability. Sourcing of renewable energy and installation of rooftop solar PV to achieve cost savings.

### Potential Challenges and Opportunities

*   **Challenges:** Supply chain constraints on helium. Geopolitical risks (Russia-Ukraine conflict and Red Sea crisis). Increased competition from new players in the merchant market and pressure on margins due to predatory pricing.
*   **Opportunities:** Increased demand in the specialty steel segment. Growing public healthcare segment demand. Customized Application PSOs.

### Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions

The company is prioritizing digitalization to enhance productivity and cost reduction. The Company has also signed a long term agreement for renewable energy sourcing at its ASU sites. A 10% appreciation/depreciation of the foreign currencies with respect to functional currency would result in a decrease in the company's net profit.

## Project Engineering Division (PED) Segment

### Management Guidance and Assumptions

Management assumes a healthy order book, continued growth in CAPEX projects pipeline.

### Market Growth Forecasts

The division expects to ride cyclic momentum with growth in the industrial sector. Strong domestic demand, public infrastructure investments, and growing financial sector driving growth.

### Planned Strategic Initiatives

Focus on design, supply, installation, and commissioning of medium to large-tonnage ASUs, nitrogen plants, and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) systems. Manufacturing of cryogenic vessels for internal use and external sales. Expansion with a new, larger workshop in Jamshedpur to meet increasing demand for cryogenic vessels.

### Capital Expenditure Plans

New workshop in Jamshedpur to expand production capacity. Investment in in-house project orders, including a Nitrous oxide plant, Nitrogen plant and a 1000 TPD ASU.

### Efficiency Improvement Targets

Maintenance of IMS certification, commitment to quality, environmental responsibility, and occupational health and safety standards.

### Potential Challenges and Opportunities

*   **Challenges:** Cyclical nature of project engineering business.
*   **Opportunities:** Robust order book, strong pipeline for onsite and in-house ASU projects.

### Scenario Analysis and Sensitivity to Key Assumptions

The company is committed to innovation, expansion, and delivering exceptional value to clients. The Company is also expanding its footprint in the glass/frit and chemical industry in the state of Gujarat.

Management applies a 10% threshold of annual consolidated turnover to each contract individually, while SEBI, in an Interim Ex Parte Order, contends that the threshold must be applied to all contracts of similar nature with a related party on an aggregate basis. The Securities Appellate Tribunal, in its Order dated May 22, 2024 ('SAT Order'), has set aside the Interim Order.
*   **Emphasis of Matter:** Emphasis of Matter was issued for uncertainties related to SEBI's ongoing investigation.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   **Consistent Application:** Accounting policies have been applied consistently across reporting periods.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   **Adequate Internal Financial Controls:** The auditors, based on their procedures and those of internal auditors, M/s Suresh Surana & Associates LLP, found the internal financial controls over financial reporting to be operating effectively.
*   **Audit Trail Feature:** The Company has an audit trail feature in its accounting software that operated throughout the year. Exception made to modification done by certain users with specific access and direct database changes.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **General Compliance:** The Company has generally complied with statutory provisions, with the material exception of a disagreement with SEBI regarding the calculation of the materiality threshold for related party transactions.
*   **Secretarial Audit:** The Secretarial Auditor's Report dated 28 May 2024 confirms general compliance, except as described in point 4 above.
*   **SEBI LODR Compliance:** The Company asserts compliance with SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) Regulations, 2015, based on legal opinions obtained, differing from SEBI's interpretation in a specific matter.
*   **Dividend Distribution Policy:** The Board's recommended dividend is in line with the Company's Dividend Distribution Policy.
*   **Cost Records:** Cost records are maintained.

*   **No Material Transactions Exceeding Threshold:** According to the Company, no related party transaction exceeded the materiality threshold of 10% of the annual consolidated turnover of the Company, using their interpretation of the regulations.
*   **Disclosure:** Related party transactions are disclosed in Note 44 of the Standalone Financial Statements.

### Subsequent Events

*   **SEBI Interim Order and SAT Order:** The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued an Interim Ex-Parte Order on April 29, 2024, regarding related party transactions. The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), on May 22, 2024, set aside the Interim Order.
*   **Proposed Dividend:** The Board recommended a dividend of 120% (Rs. 12/- per share), subject to shareholder approval.

### Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   The quality is slightly affected by the material uncertainty of SEBI's investigations.
