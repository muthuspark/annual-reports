*   **Competitive Positioning Statements:**
    *   MedPlus positions its private label as a high-quality, significantly discounted alternative to branded medicines.

### Risk Factors & Challenges

*   **Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management:**
    *   **Slower Store Additions:** Current year's store addition pace (target 300 net) is lower than initially implied, attributed to focus on private label rollout and backend strengthening.
    *   **Muted GMV Growth (this quarter):** Attributed partly to seasonality and the impact of private label (lower price point).
    *   **Supply Chain Strain:** Past rapid growth had strained the supply chain, impacting sales. This is being addressed with new warehouses.
    *   **Cost Pressures:** Wage increases and new warehouse rents impacting EBITDA.
*   **Supply Chain or Operational Constraints:** Addressed above (strain, ongoing strengthening).
*   **Market Uncertainties:** Impact of quick commerce is being monitored.
