## Audit & Compliance Analysis

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   The Independent Auditor's Report issued by Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP provides an unqualified opinion on the Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements, stating they give a true and fair view in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in India.
*   Two factual observations are present: one on the internal control effectiveness (point 14(b)), and another on the backup of books of account and other papers (point 14(h)(vi)).

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   The financial statements comply with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.
*   The historical cost convention is used, except for certain financial assets/liabilities and defined benefit plan assets, which are measured at fair value.
*   Amendments to Ind AS 1, 8, and 12 (accounting policy disclosures, definition of accounting estimates, and deferred tax) did not have any material impact.
*   The company uses a third party for risk management (pages 23 and 24).

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   The auditor's report includes a separate report ('Annexure A') on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls over financial reporting, with a positive result.
*   Internal financial controls related to maintaining a backup of accounts on servers. The audit log's maintenance was deficient at the application and database level.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   The Company has complied with all mandatory requirements of corporate governance specified in regulations 17 to 27 and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of sub-regulation (2) of regulation 46 of the Listing Regulations, as reported in the Corporate Governance Report.
*   The Company has complied with the applicable Secretarial Standards.
*   The Company claims full compliance with all applicable environmental laws/regulations/guidelines in India (Principle 6 of the BRSR).
*   No strictures or penalties were imposed on the Company by Stock Exchanges, SEBI, or any statutory authority.

### Legal Proceedings and Their Potential Impact

*   The Company discloses the impact of pending litigations on its financial position in Note 27 of both the Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements.
*   There are outstanding disputed statutory dues, especially related to income tax, sales tax/VAT, excise, service tax, customs, and GST. Management made a judgement with tax and legal advisors to determine the outcome.
*   A Supreme Court order regarding the definition of 'Basic Wage' under the Employees' Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, is mentioned, with management assessing no significant financial impact.
*   Two POSH complaints were reported and resolved.

### Related Party Transactions

*   All Related Party Transactions (RPTs) were conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business and at Arm's Length basis.
*   No Material Related Party Transactions, as per the Board's materiality threshold, were entered into.
*   No materially significant related party transactions were made with the Promoters, Directors, and/or Key Management Personnel that could potentially conflict with the Company's interests at large.
*   Note 34 of both Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements provides extensive details of transactions and balances with related parties (holding companies, fellow subsidiaries, key management personnel, and employee benefit trusts).

### Subsequent Events

*   The subsidiary, ICI India Research and Technology Centre, received approval (dated 10th May 2024) from the Regional Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, for conversion from a Section 8 company to a private limited company. The process of obtaining a fresh certificate of incorporation is underway, and management said that there is no impact on consolidated reporting.
*   The Board has recommended a Final Dividend of H 25/- per equity share, subject to shareholder approval at the ensuing AGM.

### Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The unqualified audit opinion suggests a high level of accounting quality. The consistent application of accounting policies and the use of estimates and judgments are disclosed. The Company uses a moving weighted average for inventory costing, which, while standard, can be less precise than FIFO or specific identification in times of fluctuating costs. The level of detail in the disclosures relating to employee benefit obligations, including actuarial assumptions, suggests a robust approach.
*   **Regulatory Risk Assessment:** The main area of regulatory risk identified relates to ongoing tax litigations. While the Company states its belief (based on expert advice) that these disputes are unlikely to result in a material outflow of resources, the amounts involved are material. There is a risk of adverse rulings, potential increases in provisions, and cash outflows related to these tax disputes. Compliance with environmental laws is stated, but specific quantitative disclosures of emissions are provided in BRSR, limiting the ability to independently assess the risk. The backup procedure and the inability of reporting is a source for concern.
