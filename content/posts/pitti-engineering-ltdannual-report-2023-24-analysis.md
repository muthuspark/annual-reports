### Business Segment Performance

Pitti Engineering operates primarily across two verticals: Rotating Electrical Equipment and Machined Components.

#### Rotating Electrical Equipment

This segment, the traditional core, includes electrical laminations (loose, pole, glued), sub-assemblies (stator cores, rotor packs, shafts), and value-added products like ready-for-winding (RFW) assemblies. The company is India's largest manufacturer and exporter of electrical laminations. Performance is driven by demand from power generation (hydro, thermal, wind), railways, industrial motors, appliances, and emerging sectors like EVs and data centers (DG sets). The acquisition of Bagadia Chaitra (16,000 MT capacity) significantly boosts capacity in this segment, targeting growth particularly in South India. FY24 capacity utilization for components & assemblies was 72.95%.

#### Machined Components

This newer, high-growth vertical leverages the company's engineering and machining capabilities (including casting, fabrication, heat treatment, CNC machining). It produces complex, critical components like stator frames, gear cases, axle boxes, flywheel flanges, and parts for mining (OHV wheel hubs, support seals) and renewable energy (electrolyzer parts). This segment is margin-accretive and diversifies the end-user base (Railways, Metro, Mining, Renewables). Capacity utilization for Machined Components (based on hours) was high at 90.47% in FY24. The proposed merger with Pitti Castings Private Limited aims to further vertically integrate this segment, enhance control over casting quality, reduce related-party transactions, and bring in marquee clients.

*   The significant increase in PAT (53.32% YoY) on an 11.79% YoY growth in Total Income indicates positive operating leverage.
*   While Cost of Materials is largely variable, substantial fixed/semi-fixed costs (Employee Benefits, Depreciation, portions of Other Expenses) allow profitability to increase at a faster rate than revenue once fixed costs are covered.
*   Investments in capacity expansion and automation (reflected in higher depreciation and capex) contribute to the fixed cost base but are expected to drive future efficiency and profitability as utilization increases.

### Non-recurring / Exceptional Items

*   **Other Income (Note 18):** Includes State Industrial Promotion Subsidy of ₹408.19 lakhs (FY23: ₹130.03 lakhs) and Profit on Sale of Property, Plant & Equipment (Net) of ₹15.55 lakhs (FY23: ₹7.32 lakhs), which can be considered less recurring in nature compared to core operational revenue. Change in Fair Value of Investments (₹-5.37 lakhs) is also present.
*   **Exceptional Items:** No items were classified as Exceptional in the P&L for FY24 or FY23.

### GAAP vs Non-GAAP Reconciliation

*   The financial statements are prepared as per Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), which is the applicable GAAP in India.
*   No specific non-GAAP measures requiring reconciliation were presented, apart from EBITDA, which is commonly used. EBITDA can be reconciled from the P&L: PBT (₹121.91 Cr) + Finance Costs (₹47.99 Cr) + Depreciation & Amortization (₹54.02 Cr) = ₹223.92 Cr. (Note: The reported EBITDA on page 8 is ₹177.72 Cr, calculated as PBT before Finance Costs and Depreciation/Amortization per page 48, which is ₹225.92 Cr - Finance Costs ₹47.99 Cr = ₹177.93 Cr, aligning closely. The difference might be minor definitional nuances).

### EPS Analysis (Standalone)

*   **Basic EPS:** Increased significantly to ₹28.14 in FY24 from ₹18.36 in FY23.
*   **Diluted EPS:** Increased significantly to ₹28.14 in FY24 from ₹18.36 in FY23.
*   **Trend:** Reflects the strong PAT growth during the year. The 5-year CAGR for EPS is reported at 51.02%, indicating sustained high growth in earnings per share over the medium term.

## Cash Management

### Cash Flow and Liquidity Analysis

#### Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

OCF before working capital changes improved to ₹21,590.86 lakhs in FY24 from ₹16,885.28 lakhs in FY23, driven by higher Profit Before Tax (PBT) (₹12,191.29 lakhs vs ₹7,988.49 lakhs). However, Net OCF decreased significantly to ₹7,008.11 lakhs in FY24 compared to ₹22,202.55 lakhs in FY23. This reduction was primarily due to substantial negative working capital changes of ₹(13,186.22) lakhs in FY24, compared to a positive contribution of ₹8,617.27 lakhs in FY23, mainly reflecting increased investments in inventories and receivables alongside faster payments to suppliers.

#### Investing Cash Flow (ICF)

Net cash used in investing activities increased sharply to ₹(23,824.51) lakhs in FY24 from ₹(10,936.30) lakhs in FY23. The primary driver was higher capital expenditure on Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) and intangibles, with cash outflow for purchases rising to ₹17,524.14 lakhs (FY23: ₹9,788.18 lakhs) and advances increasing to ₹4,045.64 lakhs (FY23: Nil). ROU asset additions also contributed ₹2,254.73 lakhs (FY23: ₹1,184.02 lakhs).

#### Financing Cash Flow (FCF)
