## Earnings Call Transcript Analysis Report
## Financial Performance

### Key Financial Metrics

*   Management described Q4FY25 and FY25 results as "plateauing" compared to the previous year across turnover, EBITDA, PBT, and PAT.
*   Standalone EBITDA margin guidance: "now we are going to be in the 19 to 20 range. We maintain that, and we shall be maintaining the 19% to 20% EBITDA in the coming year as well."
*   The consolidated financials were significantly impacted by accounting adjustments related to the JITF NTPC arbitration case:
    *   Rs. 144-146 crores of amortized lease receivable from NTPC in JITF's books written off.
    *   Rs. 235 crores of deferred tax assets in JITF de-recognized.
*   Term loan: Reduced to "in the vicinity of Rs. 600 to Rs. 700 crore."
*   Net worth: "in the vicinity of close to Rs. 10,000 crores."
*   Working capital: Improved to "around Rs. 1,800."
*   Hunting JV Profit (JSAW's share in consolidated PAT): "about Rs. 27 crores." The JV itself earned over Rs. 50 crore profit in its first year.
*   Dividend: "maintained the same dividend payout."

### Comparison with Previous Periods

*   Performance in Q4FY25 and FY25 was generally similar to the prior year, indicating a plateau.
*   Q4FY25 saw a dip in top-line ("dip in the last quarter top line") due to delayed budgetary allocations for Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) projects, an anomaly as Q4 is usually the strongest.
*   Order book: $1.325 billion, marginally lower than $1.4 billion last year, attributed to a deliberate slowdown in order intake during Q4. DI pipe order book stood at 6.25 lakh tons, down from 6.8 lakh tons in Q3.

### Revised Guidance or Forecasts

*   Q1 FY26 performance expected to be "similar to what we saw in Q4."
*   Full impact of JJM project revival expected from Q2 FY26 onwards.
*   FY26 performance expected to be broadly similar to FY25 and FY24, with positive impacts from completed CAPEX (DI, Seamless) and cost reduction initiatives.

### Areas of Growth or Decline

*   Growth: Expected from capacity expansions in DI and Seamless pipes, cost reduction benefits, and increased contribution from value-added products and the Hunting JV.
*   Decline: Q4FY25 topline saw a dip. Overall, the recent performance was described as "plateauing."

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

### JITF NTPC Arbitration & Restructuring

*   A Single Bench High Court judgment against JITF came as a "big surprise." An appeal has been filed with a Double Bench.
*   Rs. 850 crores previously received by JITF (under bank guarantees) has been repaid to NTPC using JITF's own sources and financial support from the promoter group.
*   Accounting adjustments in JITF: Write-off of Rs. 144-146 cr amortized lease receivable and de-recognition of Rs. 235 cr deferred tax assets.
*   Debt and quasi-debt instruments in JITF are being converted to equity. Post-conversion, Jindal Saw will own 57%, Siddheshwari 42.06%, and a foreign partner <1% of JITF.

### Debt Management

*   Continued focus on debt reduction.
*   "The debt profile is well under control and would remain that way."

### CAPEX and Expansion

*   Ongoing/Completed: Capacity expansion in DI pipes at Haresamudram (+1 lakh ton) and Seamless pipes at Nashik (to 4.5 lakh tons).
*   Future: New projects are being evaluated, with a plan of action expected by the next quarter. Assurance that new projects will be planned to avoid cash flow strain and maintain credit rating.

### Cost Reduction Initiatives

*   Introduction of PCI (Pulverized Coal Injection) and a 3rd Coke Oven Battery in Pragpur.
*   Generation of energy from waste heat.
*   These are expected to positively impact FY26 financials.

### Hunting JV (Premium Connections)

*   "The Hunting JV is doing well." Earned over Rs. 50 crore profit in its first year, with JSAW's share in PAT being Rs. 27 crore.
*   "At this point of time, we do have a first mover's advantage. On premium connection, we are the only one currently operating in India".

### Order Book Strategy

*   "Deliberately slow down taking of orders" in Q4 due to execution slowdown. The company prefers a 9-10 month order book. Current order book: $1.325 billion. Export to domestic ratio: 23-25%.

### New Business Models

*   States are adopting Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM) for water projects, expecting EPC contractor participation including equity.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends (Water Infrastructure)

*   Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM): After a slowdown, "budgetary delay of funds has all been restored. This year, the Government has released Rs. 70,000 crores." Full impact expected from Q2 FY26.
*   "The demand for the water infrastructure is very good giving rise to a lot of demand for pipe."
*   "A lot of opportunities going to come in water infra projects for at least next five to seven years."
