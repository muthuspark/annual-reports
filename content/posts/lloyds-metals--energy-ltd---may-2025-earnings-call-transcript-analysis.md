## Earnings Call Transcript Analysis: Lloyds Engineering Works Ltd. (LEWL) - FY25

## Financial Performance Analysis

### Key Financial Metrics & Comparisons (FY25)

*   **Revenue:** Grew by 3% year-on-year, driven by better iron ore realizations and record sponge iron production.
*   **EBITDA:** Grew by 13% year-on-year to INR 2,005 crores, driven by higher iron ore realizations but moderated by muted sponge iron and power realizations.
*   **Profit Before Tax:** Highest ever achieved.
*   **Iron Ore Volumes:** Flat year-on-year at 10 million tons, achieving 100% capacity for the second year.
*   **Iron Ore Sales Volume (Q4):** 1.66 million tons.
*   **Iron Ore Realization (Q4):** INR 5,994 per ton, down 6% year-on-year.
*   **Iron Ore Realization (FY25):** INR 5,766 per ton, up 6% year-on-year.
*   **Iron Ore EBITDA per ton (FY25):** INR 1,801, up 5% year-on-year.
*   **Sponge Iron Production:** Highest ever.
*   **DRI Volumes:** 308,000 tons per annum.
*   **Power Volumes:** Grew 5% year-on-year.
*   **Sponge Iron & Power Realizations:** Muted, impacting segment margins.

### Q4 FY25 Margin Subdual

*   Lower iron ore volumes due to front-ending production in earlier quarters led to lower absorption of fixed costs.
*   Sponge iron margins drastically down (0.84% PBT margin vs. 18-27% in Q2/Q3) due to "lumpy expenses on community development" and "front-loading of expenses to ramp up capacities to achieve 25 million tons."

### Exceptional Costs (Q4 FY25)

*   ESOP cost: ~INR 13 crores (non-cash).
*   Community development expenses: ~INR 17-18 crores.

### Capex

*   FY24: INR 1,690 crores.
*   FY25: INR 3,695 crores.
*   FY26 Guidance: INR 6,000 crores to INR 6,500 crores, focused on mining, pellet and steel capacities (including mining assets, beneficiation plant, 1.2 million tons wire rod plant, pellet plants, and ~INR 50 crores normal capex).

### Revised Guidance or Forecasts

*   **Iron Ore Volumes (FY26):** Potential shortfall of 1 million to 1.2 million tons from the planned 25 million tons due to mining EC approval delays.
*   **Pellet Production (FY26):** Around 2.5 million tons.

### Areas of Growth or Decline

*   **Growth:** Iron ore realizations (FY25), sponge iron production (FY25), power volumes (FY25), overall revenue and EBITDA (FY25).
*   **Decline/Subdued:** Iron ore realization (Q4 FY25 YoY), sponge iron and power realizations (FY25), iron ore volumes (Q4 FY25), overall margins (Q4 FY25).

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

### Major Strategic Announcements

*   **Thriveni MDO Business Acquisition:** NCLT approval in process, expected by Q1 FY26. Cultural integration has begun. MDO merger cost savings expected from April 1, 2025, post-NCLT order.

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Insights About Industry Trends

*   **Indian Iron Ore Market:** Buoyant, prices steady, defying international market.
*   **Steel Demand:** Consistently growing at 8% YoY in India.
*   **Government Focus:** Strong on steel capacity expansion, initiating urgent need for greenfield iron ore mining and beneficiation.
*   **Auction Route:** ~20 million tons of iron ore capacity scheduled to move from allotted to auction route annually for the next 5 years. Auctions fetching high premiums (125% to 200%).
*   **Pellet Market:** Vibrant, huge demand for lumpy ore or pellets.

### Competitive Positioning Statements

*   **Mining EC:** Expansion will make it "one of the largest mines in the country, irrespective of any mineral, except coal."
*   **Market Reach:** Detailed research (via SteelMint) indicates ~70-75% of material would be sold within 400-600 km range.
*   **Pricing Strategy:** Kept prices constant despite scope for increase.
*   **BHQ Product:** Will produce 66% Fe iron ore concentrate from low-grade BHQ (35-38% Fe), "one of the highest grade iron ore available in the country."

### Market Challenges or Opportunities Mentioned

*   **Opportunity:** Mines moving to auction route indicates strong demand and higher cost regime for competitors, benefiting Lloyds.
*   **Opportunity:** Increasing capacities of customers.
*   **Challenge (Mitigated):** International pellet realizations are poor, but domestic market offers better prices.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management

*   **Mining EC Approval Delay:** For expansion from 10 to 25 million tons. Awaiting final outcome from MOEF "very shortly," possibly by May end (worst case).
*   **Impact of EC Delay:** Potential loss of 1-1.2 million tons of iron ore volume in FY26.
*   **Monsoon Impact on Volumes:** Mitigated by pipeline commissioning and previous year's performance (2 million tons during monsoon).

### Regulatory Issues Mentioned

*   Mining EC approval from MOEF is the primary regulatory hurdle discussed.
*   NCLT approval for Thriveni MDO acquisition.

### Supply Chain or Operational Constraints

*   Historically, monsoon could affect dispatches, but the new slurry pipeline is expected to help.
*   Front-ending production in FY25 led to lower Q4 volumes.

### Market Uncertainties

*   Management refrained from predicting future commodity (iron ore/steel) prices.

## Forward-Looking Statements

### Outlook and Future Projections

*   **Iron Ore Volumes (FY26):** Target of 25 million tons, with a potential shortfall of 1-1.2 million tons (aiming for ~23.8-24 million tons).
*   **Pellet Production (FY26):** Around 2.5 million tons.
*   **Capex (FY26):** INR 6,000 - 6,500 crores.
