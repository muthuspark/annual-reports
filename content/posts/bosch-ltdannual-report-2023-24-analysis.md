## Audit and Regulatory Analysis

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

*   **Auditor's Opinion:** Unmodified opinion on the standalone and consolidated financial statements.
*   **Qualifications:**
    *   The Company did not maintain the backup of the books of account and other books and papers in electronic mode on servers physically located in India, on a daily basis, for most of the period under review, as required by rule 3 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.
    *   The meeting of the risk management committee was delayed by 5 days.
    *   Audit trail feature not enabled for changes that may be made using privileged/ administrative access at the database level, in the jointly controlled entity, Newtech Filter India Private Limited's accounting software.

### Key Accounting Policies and Changes

*   **Key Accounting Policies:** The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. Historical cost basis is used, except for certain financial assets and liabilities, and derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value.
*   **Changes in Accounting Policies:**
    *   The amendments to Ind AS 8 clarified the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies, and the correction of errors.
    *   As per amendments to Ind AS 1, 'material' accounting policies are disclosed instead of 'significant' accounting policies.
    *   Amendments to Ind AS 12 narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exception; therefore, deferred tax asset and liabilities are recognized separately for the leases.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

*   The Company maintains adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting that operated effectively.
*   The Company has an internal audit function that provides assurance on the design and effectiveness of internal controls.
*   Audit trail implemented except for an associate.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   The Company has generally complied with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, SEBI Regulations, and other applicable laws.
*   Non-compliance observed in respect of exceeding the materiality threshold for related party transactions without prior approval from the shareholders, which was later rectified and settled with SEBI.
*   Non-compliance regarding the timing of Risk Management Committee meetings, delayed by 5 days.
*   Non-compliance regarding daily server backup, not physically located in India until April 2024.

### Subsequent Events

*   The Company evaluated all events and transactions that occurred after March 31, 2024, up to May 24, 2024. No events or transactions were identified that would require recognition or disclosure.

## Analysis of Accounting Quality and Regulatory Risk Assessment

*   **Accounting Quality:** The unmodified audit opinion suggests high accounting quality. However, the qualification related to accounting records indicates an area for improvement in physical maintenance of books. The Company's use of a recognized framework (Ind AS) and detailed accounting policies indicate a commitment to transparent and reliable financial reporting.
*   **Regulatory Risk Assessment:** While the Company is generally compliant, the noted non-compliances related to related party transactions and risk management committee meetings, as well as servers located outside India and delay in taking timely actions highlight a moderate regulatory risk. The proactive resolution with SEBI and obtaining post-facto shareholder approval demonstrates the Company's willingness to address compliance issues. However, the recurrence of such issues suggests a need for enhanced internal processes.
