**Comparisons & Trends:**

*   The company delivered its "highest ever quarterly revenues and EBITDA in Q3FY25," largely driven by the first-time consolidation of the NRT business.
*   YoY revenue growth was strong at 16%, but underlying growth (ex-NRT) was a more modest 7.5%.
*   Sequential revenue decline (ex-NRT) of 3% was noted, partly due to lower sales from products like Lenalidomide in North America.
*   Gross margin improved YoY due to product mix and manufacturing leverage, offset by price erosion. Sequentially, it declined.
*   SG&A increased due to NRT business consolidation, investments in new initiatives, and higher logistics costs.
*   R&D investments continued to focus on complex generics and biosimilars.
*   EBITDA margin saw a YoY and QoQ decline.
