*   **Other Current Assets:** Decreased by around 22%, potentially due to changes in unbilled work-in-progress.

*   **Long-Term Lease Liabilities:** Decreased.
*   **Other Current Liabilities:** Decreased.
*  **Short-Term Provisions:** Decreased substantially, indicating lower provisions for anticipated short-term obligations.

* **Other Non-Current Assets**: The increase is ~29%.

#### Working Capital Trends

Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

| Period               | Current Assets ( . in Lakh) | Current Liabilities ( . in Lakh) | Working Capital ( . in Lakh) |
| :------------------- | ------------------------: | ---------------------------: | --------------------------: |
| 31st March, 2024     |                  9,107.37 |                     3,064.09 |                    6,043.28 |
| 31st March, 2023     |                  8,380.12 |                     3,697.74 |                    4,682.38 |

*   **Trend:** Working capital has significantly improved between the two periods. This is generally a positive sign, indicating greater ability to meet short-term obligations.

#### Asset Quality Metrics

*   **Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio:**  This is provided in the report. It went from 4.06 in FY23 to 5.43 times in FY24. A higher ratio is generally better, suggesting improved efficiency in collecting receivables. However, an excessively high ratio could indicate an overly strict credit policy.
*   **Fixed Asset Turnover**: Total income (8241.1)/Fixed Asset, net (1621.59) = **5.08 times**. Shows efficiency in usage of fixed assets.

#### Debt Structure and Maturity Profile

*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**  The provided data shows this ratio improved slightly from 0.24 to 0.23.  This is a relatively low level of debt, indicating conservative financing.
*   **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Debt:** A considerable portion of the debt is short-term (current borrowings), with a noticeable amount in current maturities. This indicates the company may have near term repayment obligations.
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** The report states this improved from 4.73 to 5.76. A higher ratio indicates a better ability to meet interest obligations.
* **Maturity Profile**: As per Annexure B of auditor's report, the maturity pattern for borrowings is as follows:

| Period| Amount ( . in Lakh)|
|---|---|
|0-1 year| 1,127.53|

|Principal Repayment| 603.93  | 395.28 |
|Interest Expenses| 297.8| 175.12|
| DSCR                 | 1.33   |1.35|

*   **Interpretation:** The DSCR is > 1, which means Dhruv *can* meet its debt obligations.

#### Liquidity Position and Cash Conversion Cycle

*   **Liquidity Position:**
    *   **Current Ratio:** (Current Assets / Current Liabilities). Slight Increase of 10% in the last Financial Year.
    *   **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Decreased from Rs. 708.62 Lakh to Rs. 652.41 Lakh.
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** The increase in the debtors turnover ratio suggests potential challenges in collecting receivables, which would lengthen the CCC.

#### Free Cash Flow Yield Trends

*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
    *   FY23-24: 337.14- 769.28 = -432.14 Lakh (Negative Free Cash Flow)
    *   FY 22-23: 1593.42 - 395.58 = 1197.84 Lakh
*   **Free Cash Flow Yield:** The Market Capitalization increased from 70 Crores in the last year to 200 Crores in FY 23-24. The free cash flow yield has decreased in the current year.

### Key Observations and Conclusions

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Profit after tax (PAT) showed a substantial increase (22.2% on a standalone basis), indicating improved operational efficiency and cost management.
*   **CAPEX:** The company is investing significantly in PP&E and Intangible Assets, supporting growth, but also causing negative free cash flow in the current year.
*   **Debt:** The Debt to Equity ratio is low and improved slightly, suggesting conservative financial management. However, interest and finance costs increased significantly.
*   **Liquidity:** The current ratio is healthy, but the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is a point to watch, especially combined with negative FCF.
*   **Working Capital:** Improvement in Receivable collections is required.
*   **Dividend:** Company started paying dividend from FY 23-24
*   **Global Expansion:** The Company has invested in its Wholly Owned Subsidiary for Global presence.

### Key Observations and Highlights

*   **Profitability:** Dhruv Consultancy has shown consistent profitability, with a good net profit margin. However the operating and net profit margins have fluctuated.
*   **Liquidity:** The company maintains a healthy liquidity position.
*   **Leverage:** Dhruv Consultancy has low leverage, relying more on equity financing.
*   **Efficiency**: Receivable collection is inefficient, and can be worked upon.

### Important Considerations

*   **Qualitative Factors:** Financial ratios alone don't tell the whole story. Factors like the company's reputation, client relationships, project pipeline, and regulatory environment all play a significant role in its success.
*   **Future projections:** There needs to be more work done on the ratios to improve and match with the future financial goals of the company.
