*   **Trend:** Increasing.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Diversifying revenue mix across geographies, products, and market segments. Increased R&D spending(~INR 1,966 million since listing).
*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. BEV revenue grew by 32% in FY24, but reliance on ICE-dependent products is down to 10%.
*   **Potential Financial Impact:** Significant. Revenue, EBITDA, and PAT have all grown substantially since the IPO (2.0x, 2.0x, and 2.4x, respectively, from FY21), driven largely by new products and EV programs. Failure to adapt could impact future growth.

*   **Control Effectiveness:** Partially effective. The Company has mechanisms to monitor and manage risks, but the effects cannot always be fully eliminated. Material cost as a percentage of total income decreased from 45% (FY23) to 43% (FY24), because of an improved product mix.
*   **Potential Financial Impact**: Expense and profit are affected. For instance, total expenditure registered a y-o-y increase of 16% at INR 25,287 million in FY 2023-24, compared to INR 21,747 million during FY 2022-23.

## Compliance/Regulatory Risks

*   **Severity:** Medium. Changes in regulations in the automotive industry, particularly environmental regulations are called out as a factor.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Regulatory changes are ongoing.
