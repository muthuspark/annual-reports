    *   FY24/25 Additions: 13.81 MTPA (FY24) + 8.7 MTPA (Q1FY25, incl. Burnpur acquisition).
    *   Ongoing Projects: 34 MTPA expansion across 16 locations.
    *   Acquisitions: Kesoram Cement (~11.4 MTPA, pending approvals), Parli grinding unit (1.1 MTPA + 1.2 MTPA expansion).

    *   Planned Capex: `₹32,400 Crores` over the next three years (FY25-FY27), primarily funded through internal accruals, facilitated by strong operating cash flow and low leverage (Net Debt/EBITDA 0.2x).

### Management Guidance & Assumptions

*   **Guidance (Implicit):** Continuation of strong volume growth driven by infrastructure and housing demand in India. Ability to execute large-scale capex efficiently and integrate acquisitions successfully. Maintaining cost competitiveness. Progressing on sustainability targets.
*   **Assumptions:** Stable/favorable macroeconomic conditions in India. Continued government focus on infrastructure spending. Manageable input cost environment (particularly energy and logistics).

### Market Outlook & Opportunities

*   **Positive Macro Backdrop:** India remains the fastest-growing major economy (8.2% FY24 GDP, ~7.2% FY25 proj.).
*   **Infrastructure Focus:** Government's sustained push on infrastructure (e.g., `₹11.1L Cr` outlay for FY25, PM Gati Shakti) provides significant tailwinds for cement demand. Morgan Stanley projects ~15.3% CAGR in India's infra investments over the next five years.
*   **Housing Demand:** Urbanization, nuclearization, and government focus on affordable housing (3 Cr new houses planned) support residential cement demand.

Exploring kiln electrification (Coolbrook partnership).
    *   **Circular Economy:** 5.12% TSR. Utilized significant industrial/agro/municipal waste. Plastic Negative (3.4x). 20.85% recycled input material.

    *   **Green Logistics:** Piloting EV trucks; >480 CNG/LNG vehicles deployed.
    *   **Recognition:** High ESG ratings (CDP, S&P Global CSA).

### Risk Assessment & Sensitivity (Inferred)
