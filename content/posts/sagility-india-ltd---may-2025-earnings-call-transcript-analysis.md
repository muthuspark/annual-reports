### Guidance & Forecasts

*   The company reiterated its medium-term revenue growth guidance: "low- to mid-teens revenue growth in the medium term" on an organic, constant currency basis.
*   Including BroadPath (acquired end of Jan 2025, so only 2 months in FY25 numbers), FY26 constant currency total growth is "likely to be upwards of 20%."
*   Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance: "committed to delivering a steady-state margin... around the 24% to 25%." This is *before* an expected "120 to 150 bps dilution" from the BroadPath acquisition in FY26. So, effective FY26 guidance is closer to 22.5-23.8%.

## Strategic Initiatives & Business Updates

The company continues to execute on its three-pillar growth strategy and integrate recent acquisitions.

### Growth Strategy

*   Anchored in "(1) deepening our wallet share with our existing clients, (2) expanding into mid-market health plans, and (3) selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions."
### BroadPath Acquisition

*   Contributed 30 new clients, primarily mid-market payers.
*   "We are also very encouraged to see early signs of cross sell revenue synergy between BroadPath and the rest of the Sagility business."
*   Integration is critical: "integration of BroadPath is very critical to us because it was a sizable acquisition from a client's and people point of view."
*   Impacts seasonality: "BroadPath, the seasonality will increase... their Q3 revenues are substantially higher."
### Client Metrics

*   75 active clients at FY25 end.
*   38 new clients onboarded in FY25 (30 via BroadPath). Organically, 8 new clients were added.
