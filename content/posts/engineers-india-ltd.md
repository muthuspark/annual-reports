* **Diluted EPS (Earnings Per Share):** ₹6.35


These values are from the *standalone* financial statements. Consolidated financial statements will present different figures as they incorporate the performance of subsidiaries and joint ventures.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Here's a breakdown of the cash flows for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, based on the standalone cash flow statement (all figures in Indian Rupees in Lakhs):

* **Operating Cash Flow:** ₹20,954.11
* **Investing Cash Flow:** ₹15,930.00
* **Financing Cash Flow:** ₹(17,948.84)  (Negative signifies net cash *used* in financing activities)


These figures are from the *standalone* cash flow statement.  Consolidated cash flow statements will present different figures, as they reflect the cash flows of subsidiaries and joint ventures as well.

### Cash Flow Metrics
The provided annual report doesn't explicitly state the free cash flow.  However, we can calculate it and determine the capital expenditure and dividends paid using the information provided:


* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**  The report states that capital expenditure primarily includes expenses on office renovation, furniture, fixtures, R&D, and IT assets.  A precise figure for CAPEX isn't directly given in the main financial statements, but from the Standalone Cash Flow Statement, we can see that **purchases of property, plant, equipment, investment property, intangible assets and intangible assets under development (including capital work-in-progress) totaled ₹3,336.16 lakhs**. This is a good proxy for CAPEX.


* **Dividends Paid:** The report states that ₹16,861.27 lakhs in dividends were paid during the year.


* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  Free cash flow is a metric that indicates the cash a company has available for distribution to its shareholders or reinvestment in the business after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures.  There's no direct figure presented in the report.  However, we can estimate it as follows:

    **FCF ≈ Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures**

    Therefore, an *estimated* Free Cash Flow would be:

    ₹20,954.11 lakhs - ₹3,336.16 lakhs = **₹17,617.95 lakhs**

**Important Considerations:**

* This FCF calculation is an *approximation*.  A more precise calculation would require a more detailed breakdown of capital expenditures and possibly adjustments for changes in working capital.
* The report provides a consolidated PAT and revenue figures which is higher than the Standalone PAT and Revenue. It's recommended to calculate a more accurate FCF figure using the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement if available.

Therefore, while precise figures are unavailable for all three metrics from the standalone statement, we can derive reasonable estimates based on the information presented.  Refer to consolidated statements for a more complete picture.

### Profitability Ratios
To calculate the profitability ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we'll use the standalone financial statement figures.  Remember, these will differ from consolidated figures.  All values are calculated using figures in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.

* **Gross Margin:** This is calculated as (Revenue - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue.

    (₹3,23,216.50 - ₹2,95,182.00) / ₹3,23,216.50 = **8.65%**

* **Operating Margin:** This is calculated as Operating Income / Revenue.

    ₹9,841.88 / ₹3,23,216.50 = **3.04%**


* **Net Profit Margin:** This is calculated as Net Income / Revenue.

    ₹3,569.91 / ₹3,23,216.50 = **1.10%**


* **Return on Equity (ROE):** This is calculated as Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity.  We need to calculate the average shareholders' equity:

    Average Shareholders' Equity = (Beginning Shareholders' Equity + Ending Shareholders' Equity) / 2
    Average Shareholders' Equity = (₹2,10,566.05 + ₹2,31,127.89) / 2 = ₹2,20,846.97

    ROE = ₹3,569.91 / ₹2,20,846.97 = **1.61%**


* **Return on Assets (ROA):** This is calculated as Net Income / Average Total Assets. We need to calculate the average total assets:

    Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2
    Average Total Assets = (₹4,51,189.88 + ₹4,77,144.26) / 2 = ₹4,64,167.07

    ROA = ₹3,569.91 / ₹4,64,167.07 = **0.77%**


**Important Note:** These calculations use the standalone figures.  Using the consolidated financial statement data would yield different results.  Also, the "Cost of Revenue" is inferred from the statement of profit and loss as it does not explicitly present the figure in that manner.  There might be minor discrepancies depending on rounding and which figures are used.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate the liquidity ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we'll use the standalone financial statement figures. Remember that these ratios will differ from those calculated using consolidated financial statement data.  All values are calculated using figures in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.

First, we need to identify the necessary components from the balance sheet:

* **Current Assets:** ₹2,59,122.11
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹2,42,407.83
* **Inventory:** ₹56.20
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹24,959.66

Now, we can calculate the liquidity ratios:

* **Current Ratio:** This is calculated as Current Assets / Current Liabilities.

    ₹2,59,122.11 / ₹2,42,407.83 = **1.07**

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** This is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.

    (₹2,59,122.11 - ₹56.20) / ₹2,42,407.83 = **1.07** (The inventory value is negligible in this instance, thus there is no significant difference in the current and quick ratios)

* **Cash Ratio:** This is calculated as (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities.

    ₹24,959.66 / ₹2,42,407.83 = **0.10**


**Important Note:**  These ratios are based on the standalone balance sheet.  Using the consolidated balance sheet would result in different values.  The ratios provide a snapshot of the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.  A current ratio above 1 is generally considered favorable, indicating that current assets exceed current liabilities.  However, the interpretation of these ratios should always be done in the context of the company's industry and business model.

### Efficiency Ratios
To calculate the efficiency ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we'll use the standalone financial statement figures.  Remember, these ratios will differ if calculated using the consolidated financial statements.  All calculations use values in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.

First, we need the following data from the financial statements:

* **Revenue:** ₹3,23,216.50
* **Average Total Assets:** (₹4,51,189.88 + ₹4,77,144.26) / 2 = ₹4,64,167.07
* **Average Inventory:** (₹109.03 + ₹56.20) / 2 = ₹82.62 (Note: This is a very rough approximation, using only the year-end values from the standalone statements)
* **Average Accounts Receivable:** (₹35,294.02 + ₹31,439.35) / 2 = ₹33,366.69 (Net of allowance for credit losses)


Now, we can calculate the efficiency ratios:

* **Asset Turnover:** This measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as Revenue / Average Total Assets.

    ₹3,23,216.50 / ₹4,64,167.07 = **0.70**

* **Inventory Turnover:** This measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory during a period.  It's calculated as Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.  The annual report does not provide a clear figure for Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for standalone statements; therefore, it is not possible to calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio for standalone accounts.  Refer to Consolidated accounts for the same.

* **Receivables Turnover:** This measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. It's calculated as Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable.

    ₹3,23,216.50 / ₹33,366.69 = **9.68**


**Important Note:** These calculations use the standalone figures, which may differ from the consolidated values.  Additionally, the inventory turnover ratio couldn't be calculated due to a lack of necessary standalone data (COGS). The average asset, inventory and accounts receivable values are calculated using only the beginning and ending balances; a more precise calculation would require data for each quarter.  The interpretation of these ratios needs to be considered within the context of EIL's industry and business model.  Lower asset turnover is typical in capital-intensive industries like EIL's.  A higher receivables turnover indicates quicker collection of receivables.


### Leverage Ratios
To calculate the leverage ratios for Engineers India Limited for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we will use the standalone financial statement figures.  Remember that these will differ from those calculated using consolidated financial statement data.  All calculations will use figures in Indian Rupees in Lakhs.  However, calculating some ratios proves difficult due to data limitations in the provided standalone report.

First, we need the following data from the standalone financial statements:

* **Total Debt:** ₹3,608.54 (This represents the sum of lease liabilities and other non-current financial liabilities)
* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹2,31,127.89
* **Total Assets:** ₹4,77,144.26
* **Profit Before Interest and Taxes (PBIT):** This figure is not explicitly provided in the standalone financial statements. We can approximate it using:  PBIT ≈ Profit Before Tax (PBT) + Interest Expense.  From the standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, PBT = ₹47,040.72 lakhs and interest expense (finance costs) = ₹299.53 lakhs.  Therefore, PBIT ≈ ₹47,040.72 lakhs + ₹299.53 lakhs = ₹47,340.25 lakhs.

Now, let's calculate the leverage ratios:

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** This measures the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt relative to equity. It's calculated as Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity.

    ₹3,608.54 / ₹2,31,127.89 = **0.016**  or **1.6%**

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** This indicates the proportion of a company's assets financed by debt. It's calculated as Total Debt / Total Assets.

    ₹3,608.54 / ₹4,77,144.26 = **0.0076** or **0.76%**

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** This measures a company's ability to pay its interest expenses.  It's calculated as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense.  Using our approximated PBIT value, we can estimate it as follows:

    Since PBIT includes interest expense, we will calculate the interest coverage ratio with the help of earnings before interest and tax figure approximated above:  ₹47,340.25 Lakhs/ ₹299.53 Lakhs = **158.02**


**Important Notes:**

* These calculations rely on the standalone financial statements.  The use of the consolidated financial statements would provide different results.
* The Interest Coverage Ratio calculation is an *approximation* because the standalone statement does not directly provide EBIT.  The PBIT was estimated.  A more precise calculation would require the explicit EBIT figure.
* The low debt ratios indicate that EIL has a conservative capital structure with minimal reliance on debt financing.  The high interest coverage ratio reflects a strong ability to meet its interest obligations. However, this needs to be analysed with regard to industry benchmarks.

Always remember to interpret these ratios within the context of EIL's industry and business model.  A low debt level is not unusual for a company like EIL, but it’s important to know whether this is appropriate for the sector or indicates other strategic choices about investment or capital acquisition.




## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The provided annual report does *not* contain current market capitalization, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, dividend yield, or dividend payout ratio.  These are market-based metrics that are not part of the company's financial statements.  They require the current market price of EIL's shares and other market data, which are not included in this document.  You would need to consult a financial website (like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, or Bloomberg) to obtain these figures.  They will vary depending on the current trading price of EIL's stock.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
The Engineers India Limited (EIL) annual report identifies two main business segments:  Consultancy & Engineering and Turnkey Projects.  However, the report does not provide sufficient detail for a complete breakdown of all requested metrics for each segment.

* **Market Share:** The report does not provide specific market share data.
* **Key Products/Services:** This segment delivers engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) services and Lump Sum Turnkey (LSTK) projects, including refineries, petrochemical plants, and other industrial facilities.
* **Geographic Presence:** Similar to the Consultancy & Engineering segment, the report indicates both domestic and international presence; the total revenue is presented in the disaggregated revenue table.

**Missing Information:**

The annual report lacks specific details on market share for both segments and a breakdown of revenue and operating margin by geography within each segment.  It also doesn't break down revenue by specific project or product within the segments. This makes it challenging to provide a more granular analysis.

**Overall:**

While the report outlines EIL's activities across various sectors,  the presentation of segment-specific data is limited, hindering a more complete analysis. The company's diversification strategy is apparent, but the relative financial success of each area within the broader segments is not fully transparent.



## Risk Management
### Risk Assessment
The Engineers India Limited (EIL) annual report identifies several key risk factors, but the level of detail provided varies.  The report does not consistently provide a numerical assessment of likelihood and impact severity for each risk.

### Audit Information
**I. Auditor's Opinion:**

The independent auditor's report (Datta Singla & Co.) for the standalone and consolidated financial statements expresses an **unmodified (clean) opinion**.  This means the auditors found the financial statements to present a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  However, there were two emphasis of matter paragraphs highlighting:

1.  **Revenue Recognition from Construction Contracts:** The auditor noted the complexities involved in revenue recognition from long-term construction contracts due to the significant management judgments in assessing contract performance and related estimates.  While the auditor concluded the revenue was appropriately recognized, this was flagged as a key audit matter.

2.  **Contingent Liabilities:** The auditor highlighted the existence of numerous commercial claims, employee claims, and tax and legal disputes.  The assessment of the potential financial impact of these contingent liabilities involves significant management judgment, which was reviewed by the auditor.

These emphasis-of-matter paragraphs do *not* modify the auditor's overall unmodified opinion, but draw attention to significant areas of judgment and estimation involved in the preparation of the financial statements.

**II. Key Accounting Policies:**

The annual report outlines several key accounting policies employed by Engineers India Limited (EIL).  Key aspects include:

* **Revenue Recognition:** Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized over time based on the percentage of completion method for long-term contracts, and when control of services is transferred to the customer for other contracts.  Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the percentage of completion.

* **Intangible Assets:**  Software is capitalized and amortized over three years (or immediately if the cost is less than ₹5 lakhs).

* **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** PPE is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the useful lives of the assets.  Capital work-in-progress is accounted for separately.

* **Leases:**  EIL follows IFRS 16 and accounts for leases as either operating or finance leases.

* **Investment Properties:**  These are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.  Independent valuations are obtained annually.

* **Foreign Currency:** Transactions and balances are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date or balance sheet date, respectively, and exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss.

* **Impairment of Assets:** Both financial and non-financial assets are tested for impairment when indicators suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

* **Financial Instruments:**  Financial assets are classified and measured based on their business model and contractual terms as Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI), or Amortized Cost.

* **Government Grants:**  These are recognized when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and compliance with conditions. Revenue grants reduce related expenses, while grants related to assets are recognized as deferred income.

* **Oil and Gas Exploration Activities:**  The "successful efforts method" is used for accounting for these activities.

* **Income Taxes:**  Both current and deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method.

* **Employee Benefits:**  Defined contribution plans (like Provident Fund) are expensed when the services are rendered. Defined benefit plans (like gratuity and post-retirement medical benefits) are accounted for using actuarial valuations.  Significant judgments and estimations are involved in determining the defined benefit obligations.


These policies are applied consistently across the standalone and consolidated financial statements, except where indicated.  The report emphasizes the role of management judgment and estimation in several of these key areas, particularly revenue recognition, impairment, and the valuation of contingent liabilities.  The independent auditor's report highlights the importance of the management's judgment and estimates used for preparing the financial statements.
