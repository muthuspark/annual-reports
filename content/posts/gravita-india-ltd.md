### 7. Free Cash Flow Yield Trends

Free Cash Flow Yield not directly calculable from provided data, as market capitalization data is absent.

### Peer Comparison

Peer comparison is not possible with provided information.

### Forward Projections

Based purely on limited historical cash flow data from FY23 and FY24:

*   **OCF:** A slight decrease was observed. Assuming a stable business environment, a modest growth or maintenance of current OCF levels is a conservative projection.
*   **ICF:** Significant investments were made. Projecting this trend is difficult without stated company expansion plans. A decrease may be possible depending on plan.
*   **FCF:** The Group generated postive free cash flow in 2024. FCF is highly dependent on strategic decisions regarding debt and investment.

**Important Disclaimer:** This is not a forecast. The historical data is insufficient for a reliable projection, representing only two financial years. External factors, strategic decisions, and market conditions could significantly alter these figures. This is merely an illustrative extrapolation.

*Industry averages are estimates and can vary widely.
**ROIC Calculation Note, NOPAT and Invested Capital were not able to be calculated based on the available information. It was estimated using the return on capital employed(ROCE) in the provided information.
*** Gross Profit was not able to be calulated based on the available information.

**Observations:**
*   Gravita's ROE, ROA, and estimated ROIC are significantly higher than general industry averages, indicating superior profitability and efficiency in utilizing assets and invested capital.
*   The decreasing trend of ROE, ROA and ROIC could be due to the rapid expansion and high cpaital deployed by the company.
*   Profit margins (EBITDA and Net Profit) are within or above the typical industry range and show a positive trend of growth.

## Liquidity Ratios

| Ratio          | Formula                      | 2022-23 | 2023-24 | Industry Average (Estimate)* |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Current Ratio  | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | 1.45    | 1.55   | 1.5-2.0                      |
| Quick Ratio    |   (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities        |    0.62  |   0.73       | 1.0-1.5                      |

*Industry averages are estimates.

**Observations:**

*   The current ratio is below the general benchmark, indicating a potentially tighter liquidity position, but still adequate to cover short-term obligations.
*   The quick ratio is significantly below the typical range, suggesting potential challenges in meeting immediate obligations without relying on inventory sales.
*   The cash ratio is also below the typical range, further underlining a limited immediate cash availability.

## Efficiency Ratios

*Industry averages are estimates, especially for inventory turnover which is highly industry-specific.

**Observations:**

*   Asset turnover is higher than the general industry average, but has decreased significantly in 23-24, implying the Company's substantial growth has not yet translated to increased revenue efficiency.
*   Inventory turnover is within the typical range, suggesting reasonably efficient inventory management, however there is a decreasing trend.
*   Receivables turnover is high, indicating efficient collection of receivables, but decreasing.
*   Working capital turnover is high, indicating the company is efficient in using its working capital to generate sales, but decreasing.

## Leverage Ratios

| Ratio                   | Formula                                    | 2022-23 | 2023-24 | Industry Average (Estimate)* |

*Industry averages are estimates.

**Observations:**

*   The debt-to-equity ratio is within a reasonable range compared to industry norms, although it has increased, showing a rising dependence on debt.
*   The interest coverage ratio is low and has decreased significantly, indicating a reduced ability to cover interest expenses from earnings. This is a potential area of concern.

## Segment-wise ROIC

As per the data availability, segment wise ROIC cannot be computed, as operating profit and investment details are missing.

## Working Capital Ratios

| Ratio                     | Formula                                             | 2022-23     | 2023-24    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Receivables Days          | (Average Trade Receivables / Revenue) * 365         |      18     |       24    |
| Inventory Days            | (Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365      |      55    |  60 |
| Payables Days             | (Average Trade Payables / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365 |          24    |      23|

**Observations:**

*   The receivables days are low, indicating quick collection. The increase from 18 to 24 days may need monitoring.
*   Inventory days are moderately high and showing an increasing trend, suggesting a potential build-up of inventory.
* Payables days is very low, indicating quicker payments to the creditors.

## Comparison with Industry and Significant Deviations

The major deviations include:

*   **Higher Profitability:** Gravita's ROE, ROA, and ROIC are all well above typical industry averages.
*   **Lower Liquidity:** Current and quick ratios are lower than industry benchmarks.
*   **High Efficiency:** Asset and Working capital turnover ratios are significantly above the average.
*   **Declining Interest Coverage:** Although the debt-to-equity ratio is moderate, the declining interest coverage ratio is a point of concern.
*   **Increasing Working Capital Cycle:** All days working capital ratios are showing a negative trend.

By analysing the consolidated financials, a more holistic view of the Group's performance can be constructed. The individual entity analysis provides the granular detail, but the consolidation aggregates the performance, providing the most relevant perspective for overall assessment.

## Accounting Quality Analysis

**Areas of Concern:**

*   **Qualification in Audit Opinion:** The qualification regarding the non-accounting of employee benefit expenses is a significant concern. It indicates a deviation from Ind AS and impacts the accuracy of reported profits.
*   **Material Weakness in Internal Control:** The identified material weakness related to the accounting for employee benefits raises concerns about the effectiveness of internal financial controls.
*   **Contingent Tax Liabilities**: The substantial increase in contingent liabilities should be analyzed.

**Positive Aspects:**

*   **Transparency in Disclosures:** The Company provides detailed disclosures, adhering to the requirements of Ind AS.
*   **Use of Standard Accounting Policies:** The consistent application of accounting policies and use of established methods (e.g., straight-line depreciation, weighted average cost for inventory) enhances comparability.

## Regulatory Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk:** Moderate.

**Key Factors:**

*   **Compliance with Laws:** Company has generally complied with applicable laws and regulations, including Secretarial Standards.
*   **Tax Disputes:** The significant contingent liability related to customs duty demands, though contested by the Company, represents a regulatory risk.
*   **Listing Regulations:** The Company is subject to SEBI Listing Regulations and has generally maintained compliance.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   **Risk Management Framework:** The Company has a risk management framework in place, addressing market, liquidity, and credit risks.
*   **Hedging Activities:** The use of hedging instruments for foreign currency and commodity price risks demonstrates proactive risk mitigation.
