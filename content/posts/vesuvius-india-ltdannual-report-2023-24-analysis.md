Net cash inflow from operating activities grew substantially compared to FY23.

#### Business Segment Performance

*   The Company operates primarily as a single segment: manufacturing, trading, and servicing refractory goods for high-temperature industries (Steel, Cement, Aluminium, Foundry, etc.).
*   Performance is heavily influenced by the domestic steel industry, which consumes ~70% of refractory products in India.
*   Revenue is predominantly domestic (97% in FY24), with exports contributing 3.1%. Key customers include major steel producers (e.g., Tata Steel, SAIL, JSW, JNIL).
*   Growth is intrinsically linked to capital expenditure and capacity utilization within the Indian steel, cement, and non-ferrous metals sectors.

#### Major Strategic Initiatives & Progress

*   **Innovation & Technology Leadership:** Launched several new products/technologies (Sigma 2SL, Supermag, ATOM, Supergard OBL, ANTERIS 360, BASILITE QuickStart, DuraPlate, DuraSleeve, OptiClean+ Purge Plug). Commissioned India's first Robotic Tube Changer at Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Localized production of key products (Sigma 2SL).
*   **Capacity Expansion:** Commissioned new Mould Flux, AlSi Monolithic, and Basic Monolithic plants in Visakhapatnam, adding significant capacity (250,000 tonnes annually) and aligning with the 'Make in India' initiative. Ongoing upgrades at existing plants.
*   **Operational & Customer Excellence:** Supported key customer milestones (Tata Steel H Blast Furnace 50MT, JNIL EAF life extension, Tata KPO/JVML blast furnace commissioning). Implemented advanced solutions like BOF Gunning Shooter (SAIL-RSP) and achieved record performance (40 heats) with refractory systems at JSOL.
*   **Safety Excellence:** Maintained Zero LTI in FY24. Implemented VR-based safety training and conducted multiple safety campaigns across various risk areas (Hand, Material Handling, LOTO, Fire, Road, Machine, Slips/Trips/Falls, PPE).

#### Risk Landscape Changes

*   **Key Risks:** Continued volatility in raw material prices and availability (geopolitical/supply chain disruptions); competition from imports; cyclicality of end-user industries (steel, cement); cyber security threats; ESG-related risks.
*   **Mitigation:** Strategic sourcing, localisation efforts, inventory management, focus on high-performance/differentiated products, cost efficiency programs, strong customer relationships, robust internal controls, Speak Up policy, and enhanced cyber security measures. Auditors noted areas for improvement in IT controls (daily backup location, database audit trails) but found internal financial controls over reporting adequate.
*   **Risk Management Framework:** Formal policy reviewed by Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, and Board. Continuous identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring process in place.

#### ESG Initiatives & Metrics

*   **Environmental:** Achieved 100% renewable electricity consumption (1,589 MWh solar generation + REC offsets). Progress on Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) goals (Mehsana achieved). Focus on waste reduction/recycling and sustainable packaging (reusable steel boxes). Product innovation targets reduction in customer carbon footprint.

*   **Investing Cash Flow (ICF):** Increased to ₹23,266 Lakhs in FY2024 from ₹3,010 Lakhs in FY2023, dominated by higher payments for PPE acquisition amounting to ₹23,266 Lakhs (FY23: ₹12,814 Lakhs). Other activities included proceeds from PPE disposal (₹1,651 Lakhs), interest received (₹2,414 Lakhs), and net investment in fixed deposits (₹1,918 Lakhs outflow).
*   **Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Increased slightly to ₹2,756 Lakhs in FY2024 from ₹1,822 Lakhs in FY2023, driven by dividend payments (₹2,588 Lakhs vs ₹1,674 Lakhs).
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
    *   FCF (2024) = ₹25,669 Lakhs - ₹23,266 Lakhs = ₹2,403 Lakhs
    *   FCF (2023) = ₹8,920 Lakhs - ₹12,814 Lakhs = -₹3,894 Lakhs
    Indicates operating cash generation in FY2024 was sufficient to cover capital expenditures.
