## Gufic Biosciences Limited Financial Analysis (FY 2023-24)

### Financial Performance Analysis (FY 2023-24)

Gufic Biosciences Limited reported standalone total revenue from operations of ₹80,667.57 lakhs for the financial year 2023-24, an increase from ₹69,062.08 lakhs in the previous financial year. Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization (EBITDA) stood at ₹14,804.86 lakhs, compared to ₹13,722.52 lakhs in FY 2022-23. The EBITDA margin for FY 2023-24 was 18.4%, a slight decrease from 19.8% in the previous year. Net Profit for FY 2023-24 was ₹8,613.55 lakhs, up from ₹7,970.48 lakhs. The domestic market constituted 89.07% of turnover, with exports at 10.93%; the company aims to expand export revenue. Consolidated financials mirror standalone figures as the key subsidiary, Gufic UK Limited, had no operational activity during the year. A final dividend of ₹0.10 per equity share (10%) has been recommended, with a total payout of ₹1,00,27,750.60.

Key financial ratios indicate an increase in the Debtors Turnover Ratio to 3.01 times (PY 2.40 times), attributed to longer credit periods for the new 'Sparsh' division. The Interest Coverage Ratio declined to 9.64 times (PY 14.82 times) due to increased working capital loans associated with the Sparsh division. The Debt-Equity Ratio improved to 0.60 times (PY 0.90 times) following an equity share allotment and debt repayment. Return on Net Worth decreased to 16.17% (PY 22.92%) primarily due to the increased equity base from the share allotment and significant capital expenditure on the Indore plant, which is yet to contribute to revenue.

During FY24, the company raised ₹99.99 crores through a preferential allotment of 33,33,000 equity shares at ₹300 per share to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited (Non-Promoter). These funds were fully utilized for the repayment of debts. Standalone R&D expenditure for FY24 was ₹2,316.52 lakhs (Capital: ₹915.23 lakhs, Revenue: ₹1,401.29 lakhs), a decrease from ₹3,930.22 lakhs in FY23 (Capital: ₹2,859.20 lakhs, Revenue: ₹1,071.02 lakhs).

### Strategic Pillars and Business Operations

The company's operations are structured around four primary pillars:

#### Critical Care (Life-Saving Injectables)

Addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) through scientific engagement and development of novel antifungals and first-in-class antibiotics. Key brands include Guficap, Micafung (market leader in Micafungin), Polyfic (No.1 in Polymyxin-B Injection), Ticofic, Tigefic, Doxific, and Merofic. Dalbavancin, a second-generation lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, received DCGI approval for manufacturing and marketing, targeting Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy (OPAT). Cavim (Ceftazidime + Avibactam) is recognized among top new launches. Immunocin-Alpha for sepsis completed trials, awaiting DCGI approval. A room-temperature stable life-saving antifungal has been developed, and a first-in-class antifungal is set for launch at a reduced price. A novel synthetic analgesic for pain management has been in-licensed.

#### Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART)

Providing hormonal and support therapies for IVF cycles. Investments are focused on developing recombinant alternatives to critical hormones (product readiness expected in coming years) and innovative treatments for recurrent implantation failure (Guficin Alpha launched) and endometriosis (Thymosin Alpha 1 trial concluded). Supergraf (ultra-purified HMG) and Dydrogesterone 20/30mg Extended-Release (ER) tablets are key pipeline products.

#### Toxins

Democratizing access to botulinum toxin for cosmetic and therapeutic neurological applications through clinical trials and training. Stunnox (botulinum toxin) trial results compared favorably against a market leader, with acceptance by over 1,100 cosmetologists. Zarbot, for neurology applications, gained acceptance among over 100 neurologists within a year of launch.

#### Science-Based Nutraceuticals

Developing Boswellia serrata-based nutraceuticals for pain management and other conditions like bronchial asthma and osteo-muscular pain. Polmacoxib (Stellar and Healthcare divisions) strengthens orthopedic offerings and supports nutraceutical business expansion. Gufican/Gufibis (topical cannabis 3% formulation) launched for pain management.

### Operational Performance and Expansion

A new manufacturing facility in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, has received a Drug Manufacturing License and is undergoing qualification and trial runs. This facility is expected to more than double the company's production capacity, particularly for lyophilized injections, positioning Gufic as one of the world's largest producers in this segment. The Sparsh division, with its direct-to-hospital distribution model, established channels with over 1,400 hospitals by FY 2024 end, launching 92 molecules. SeraSeal, an innovative hemostatic agent, is a key product in this division.

### International Business

The company is focusing on owning product registrations to enhance market access. FY 2024 saw new product registrations in Sri Lanka, Chile, Myanmar, Malaysia, and approvals for injectables in Australia, UK, and Brazil. Strategic focus remains on Europe and LATAM regions. Approximately 200 products are registered across regulated and semi-regulated markets, with over 150 additional products in the pipeline for registration in over 40 countries.

### Research and Development (R&D)

R&D expenditure (revenue) was ₹1,208.51 lakhs in FY24, up from ₹1,041.04 lakhs in FY23. Capital expenditure on R&D was ₹507.73 lakhs (FY24) versus ₹273.07 lakhs (FY23). The R&D pipeline includes over 50 products targeting regulated and semi-regulated markets.

#### Niche Molecule Pipeline Highlights

*   **Drug 5 (Next-Generation Azole Antifungal):** Prodrug effective against Candida and Aspergillus species, higher bioavailability.

Approximately 30 products were launched in domestic and international markets in FY 2023-24, with around 25 more set for commercialization and over 70 new products in development.

### Capital Structure and Fund Utilization

During FY 2023-24, the company issued and allotted 33,33,000 equity shares at ₹300 per share (including ₹299 premium) to M/s. Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited on a preferential basis, raising ₹99.99 crores. These funds were fully utilized for repayment of debts. The Gufic Biosciences Limited Employees Stock Option Plan 2023 (Gufic ESOP 2023) was approved for up to 5,00,000 stock options; 6,000 options were granted on June 27, 2024.

### Key Financial Ratios and Analysis (Standalone)

*   **Return on Net Worth:** 16.17% (FY24) vs. 22.92% (FY23). Decrease due to increased Equity Share Capital and share premium from preferential allotment, and significant investment (approx. ₹287-300 crores mentioned across MDA and notes) in the Indore plant where production has not yet commenced.
*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** 4.01 times (FY24) vs. 4.58 times (FY23).
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** 9.64 times (FY24) vs. 18.06 times (FY23). Decrease due to increased working capital loans resulting from higher debtors associated with the Sparsh division's credit terms and increased finance costs.
*   **Debt-Equity Ratio:** 0.60 (FY24) vs. 0.91 (FY23). Decrease primarily due to increased equity from preferential allotment and repayment of term loans.

*   **Net Profit Margin:** 10.68% (FY24) vs. 11.54% (FY23).

Mittal Agarwal & Co., issued an unmodified opinion on both standalone and consolidated financial statements for FY 2023-24. Key Audit Matters highlighted were Revenue from Operations and Inventory valuation, its existence and provisions. The company used Tally Edit Log software until November 30, 2023, and migrated to SAP from December 1, 2023, with both systems having audit trail features.

### Industry Outlook and Company Position

The global pharmaceutical market was estimated at $1.6 trillion in 2023. India's pharmaceutical industry, ranked third by volume, is projected to reach $130 billion by 2030 and $450 billion by 2047. Growth drivers include cost-effective medicines, indigenization, digital healthcare technology, and patent cliff opportunities. Challenges include regulatory pressures (US-FDA), price controls, supply chain disruptions, and R&D investment needs. The Indian government's initiatives like 'Ayushman Bharat', National Medical Device Policy, PLI schemes, and increased budget allocations for pharma infrastructure are supportive.
Gufic aims to leverage its expanded capacity from the Indore plant for complex injectables and focus on its four strategic pillars to drive growth in domestic and international markets.

## Gufic Biosciences Limited FY 2023-24 Financial Performance Analysis

### Revenue and Profitability

Gufic Biosciences Limited demonstrated revenue growth in FY 2023-24. Standalone Total Revenue from Operations increased to ₹80,667.57 lakhs from ₹69,062.08 lakhs in FY 2022-23, a growth of approximately 16.80%. Consolidated revenue mirrored this performance due to the inactive status of its UK subsidiary, Gufic UK Limited, during the fiscal year.

Profit before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization (EBITDA) on a standalone basis rose to ₹14,804.86 lakhs in FY 2023-24 from ₹13,722.52 lakhs in the prior year, an increase of 7.89%. The EBITDA margin, however, saw a contraction, declining to 18.35% in FY 2023-24 from 19.87% in FY 2022-23.

Net Profit (Profit for the year) on a standalone basis increased to ₹8,613.55 lakhs in FY 2023-24 from ₹7,970.48 lakhs in FY 2022-23, marking an 8.07% growth. The Net Profit Margin for FY 2023-24 stood at 10.68%, compared to 11.54% in FY 2022-23.

The financial consistency between standalone and consolidated figures is attributed to Gufic UK Limited having no operational activities in FY 2023-24, despite an investment made by the parent company on September 13, 2023.

### Segment Performance and Market Focus

The domestic market remains the primary revenue driver, accounting for 89.07% of the company's turnover in FY 2023-24, with exports contributing the remaining 10.93%. A strategic focus is indicated on expanding revenue from export markets. The company operates within a single segment: Pharmaceuticals.

### Key Financial Ratios and Balance Sheet Items

*   **Debtors Turnover Ratio:** Decreased from 3.87 times (implied from prior year data if FY23 was 3.01) to 3.01 times in FY24. This is attributed to increased debtors following the launch of the 'Sparsh' division, which offers longer credit periods.
*   **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Decreased to 4.01 times in FY24 from 4.56 times (implied).
*   **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Declined to 9.64 times in FY24 from 17.78 times (implied). This is linked to increased working capital loans due to higher debtors from the Sparsh division and a general increase in finance costs from ₹774.46 lakhs in FY23 to ₹1,154.19 lakhs in FY24 (standalone).
*   **Current Ratio:** Stood at 1.61 times in FY24, compared to 1.63 times (implied).

### Expenditure Analysis

*   **Cost of Materials Consumed:** Remained relatively stable at ₹33,814.96 lakhs in FY24 compared to ₹33,424.69 lakhs in FY23, despite revenue growth, suggesting potential efficiency or product mix changes.
*   **Employee Benefits Expense:** Increased to ₹10,046.51 lakhs in FY24 from ₹8,168.61 lakhs in FY 2022-23, reflecting an expansion in human resources or wage inflation.
*   **Other Expenses:** Rose to ₹16,251.96 lakhs in FY24 from ₹13,877.24 lakhs in FY 2022-23, driven by increased sales promotion, transport, and legal & professional fees.

*   Outgo in foreign currency: ₹20,483.07 lakhs in FY24 (₹27,156.19 lakhs in FY23).

The significant reduction in foreign currency outgo compared to earnings has positively impacted the net foreign exchange position.

### Strategic Focus and Operational Highlights

The company's strategy revolves around four primary pillars:

Market leadership with Guficap, Micafung (No.1 in Micafungin), Polyfic (No.1 in Polymyxin-B).
*   **Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART):** Investing in recombinant hormone alternatives, advancements in endometriosis treatment (Thymosin Alpha 1 trial completed), and innovative products like Guficin Alpha (for Recurrent Implantation Failure) and Supergraf (ultra-purified HMG).
*   **Toxins:** Democratizing access to botulinum toxin for cosmetic and therapeutic neurological applications through clinical trials and training. Stunnox (aesthetic) and Zarbot (neurology) are key products, with Zarbot gaining acceptance among neurologists.
*   **Science-Based Nutraceuticals:** Continued development of Boswellia serrata-based nutraceuticals. Introduction of Polmacoxib (orthopedic specialty) and Gufican/Gufibis (topical cannabis 3% for pain management).

#### Capacity Expansion

This facility is crucial for meeting increasing global demand and supporting expansion in regulated markets.

#### International Business

Focus on Europe and LATAM, leveraging existing formulations and identifying market gaps. Secured new registrations in Sri Lanka, Chile, Myanmar, Malaysia, Australia, UK & Brazil. Approximately 200 products registered internationally with 150+ in the pipeline across 40+ countries.

#### Internal Controls

Successful SAP implementation in FY 2023-24 to enhance financial and operational controls. An in-house internal audit team reports to the Audit Committee.

### Outlook

Gufic anticipates continued growth driven by its diversified product portfolio, particularly complex injectables. The Indore facility's operationalization is a key near-term catalyst. The company aims to launch approximately 25 products in FY25, with over 70 new products in development. Initiatives like "Sankalp" (patient assistance program) and innovative delivery systems (Merofic Dual Chamber Bag) are expected to enhance market penetration and patient engagement.

### Risk Factors

The company identifies business risks (concentration, competition, price, international operations, human capital), financial risks (credit, treasury/forex, liquidity), and external risks (legal, cybersecurity, market, IP). Mitigation strategies include diversification, quality focus, cost control, hedging, robust credit approval processes, and compliance monitoring.

### Conclusion

Gufic Biosciences Limited reported a year of revenue growth and increased net profit in FY 2023-24, albeit with some pressure on operating margins. Strategic investments in capacity expansion (Indore plant), R&D for complex injectables, and market development across its four core pillars position the company for future growth, particularly in international markets. The successful preferential allotment has strengthened the equity base and supported debt repayment. Challenges include managing credit periods in new divisions and ensuring the new capacity translates into improved profitability metrics once fully operational. The focus on exports and innovative product launches will be critical for sustained value creation.
