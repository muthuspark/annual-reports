## Overview
### Detailed Analysis


This analysis looks into Akzo Nobel India Limited's (ANIL) Annual Report for FY2023-24, covering its financial performance, business segments, risk management, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.

**I. Financial Performance Highlights:**

ANIL reported a record year, achieving new highs in revenue, gross margin, EBIT from operations, and Profit After Tax (PAT).  Key figures include:

* **Revenue from Operations:** ₹39,616 million (₹38,021 million in FY2022-23) - a ~4.2% increase.
* **Profit After Tax (PAT):** ₹4,267 million (₹3,351 million in FY2022-23) - a ~27.4% increase.
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 32% (26% in FY2022-23) - a significant improvement, indicating increased profitability relative to shareholder investment.
* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** ₹93.70 (₹73.58 in FY2022-23) - a ~27.3% increase.
* **Dividend per share:** ₹75 (same as FY2022-23) - maintaining a consistent payout.
* **Cash from Operations (before tax):** ₹6,567 million - strong cash generation.

While the report notes pressure from industry-wide price corrections in the later part of FY2024, raw material deflation and favorable product mix allowed for margin and profit expansion.  Working capital improvements further strengthened operating cash flow.

**Key Financial Ratios (Standalone):**

* **Debtors Turnover:** 7.0x (7.3x in FY2022-23) - slight decrease, indicating potentially slower collection of receivables.
* **Inventory Turnover:** 3.7x (3.6x in FY2022-23) - slight increase, suggesting improved inventory management.
* **Interest Coverage:** 50.6x (37.3x in FY2022-23) - substantial increase, demonstrating strong ability to cover interest expenses.
* **Current Ratio:** 1.3x (1.5x in FY2022-23) - decreased, suggesting potentially tighter liquidity.
* **Operating Profit Margin:** 16% (13.8% in FY2022-23) - significant increase, indicating improved operational efficiency.
* **Net Profit Margin:** 10.8% (8.8% in FY2022-23) - considerable improvement.
* **Return on Net Worth (RONW):** 32.3% (26.0% in FY2022-23) - another strong indicator of profitability.
* **Debt-to-Equity:** 4.5% (5.3% in FY2022-23) - decreased, indicating improved financial leverage.

**II. Business Segments:**

ANIL operates across many key segments:

* **Decorative Paints:** This is the largest segment, driven by product launches, a strong projects business, and brand building activities.  Growth was impacted by price corrections towards the end of the year. Key initiatives included the Dulux Assurance™ warranty program, new products like Dulux Weathershield Protect Rainproof and Sadolin PU coatings, and expansion into mass and economy segments.
* **Automotive & Specialty Coatings (ASC):** This segment performed strongly due to growth in the Indian automobile industry, bodyshop wins, distribution expansion, and strong brand performance.

* **Community Engagement:**  Significant CSR spending (₹77.47 million) focused on skill development (including vocational training for women and marginalized communities), education, and community healthcare.

**Governance:**

* **Strong Corporate Governance Framework:**  Includes an independent audit committee, a risk management committee, and a robust code of conduct.
* **Transparency and Disclosure:**  Commitment to transparent reporting and stakeholder engagement.
* **Compliance:**  Adherence to all applicable laws and regulations.

**V. Conclusion:**

Akzo Nobel India Limited delivered a strong financial performance in FY2023-24, driven by record revenue and profitability across its business segments.  The company shows a clear commitment to sustainable and innovative growth, backed by a robust risk management framework and ambitious ESG targets.  While some key financial ratios indicate areas for attention (e.g., current ratio and debtors turnover), the overall financial health and strategic direction of the company appear positive.  The company's focus on sustainability and social responsibility further enhances its long-term prospects.  Further analysis might involve comparing ANIL's performance to its competitors within the Indian paints and coatings market to better understand its market position and competitive advantage.

## Balance Sheet
### Asset Analysis
Based on the provided Akzo Nobel India Limited Annual Report for FY2023-24, here are the values for the requested line items (in millions of Indian Rupees):

* **Total Assets:** ₹29,030
* **Current Assets:** ₹19,209
* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** ₹2,730
* **Accounts Receivable (Trade Receivables):** ₹5,754
* **Inventories:** ₹6,115

Please note that these figures are from the **Standalone Financial Statements**.  The Consolidated Financial Statements show slightly different values due to the inclusion of the subsidiary company's financials.

### Liability Analysis
Here are the values from Akzo Nobel India Limited's Standalone Financial Statements for FY2023-24 (in millions of Indian Rupees):

* **Total Liabilities:** ₹15,738
* **Current Liabilities:** ₹14,236
* **Long-Term Debt:**  The report doesn't explicitly state "long-term debt" as a single line item. However, long-term components of liabilities are shown under:
    * **Lease Liabilities (Non-current):** ₹451 million
    * **Other Financial Liabilities (Non-current):** ₹20 million
    * **Provisions (Non-current):** ₹940 million

* **Accounts Payable (Trade Payables):**  The report breaks this down further:
    * **Total outstanding dues of micro enterprises and small enterprises:** ₹321 million
    * **Total outstanding dues other than micro enterprises and small enterprises:** ₹9,657 million  (This includes payables to related parties and other creditors).


It's essential to remember that these figures are from the **Standalone Financial Statements**. The Consolidated Financial Statements would include the subsidiary's liabilities, resulting in different totals.

### Equity Analysis
From Akzo Nobel India Limited's Standalone Financial Statements for FY2023-24 (in millions of Indian Rupees):

* **Shareholders' Equity:** ₹13,292
* **Retained Earnings:** ₹7,739  (This is part of the "Other Equity" section)
* **Share Capital:** ₹455

These figures are from the Standalone Financial Statements.  The Consolidated Financial Statements would differ slightly due to the inclusion of the subsidiary's equity.



## Income Statement
### Operating Performance
Here's a summary of the income statement information for Akzo Nobel India Limited's Standalone Financial Statements for FY2023-24 (all figures in millions of Indian Rupees):

* **Revenue:** ₹39,616  (This is "Revenue from Operations" plus "Other Income")
* **Cost of Revenue:** This isn't a single line item.  To approximate it, we'd need to add the following expense categories:  Cost of Materials Consumed (₹20,093 million), Purchases of Stock-in-Trade (₹2,083 million), and the Change in Inventories (₹52 million).  This results in an approximate Cost of Revenue of **₹22,228 million**.  However, this is an approximation, and doesn't perfectly reflect the true cost of revenue as other direct costs are possibly included in other expense categories.
* **Gross Profit:**  Revenue (₹39,616 million) -  Approximate Cost of Revenue (₹22,228 million) = **₹17,388 million** (This is also an approximation)
* **Operating Expenses:** This would be the sum of many expense categories: Employee Benefits Expense (₹3,271 million), Finance Costs (₹125 million), Depreciation and Amortization Expense (₹823 million), and Other Expenses (₹7,796 million).  Therefore, the total Operating Expenses is approximately **₹12,015 million**.
* **Operating Income:**  This would be calculated by subtracting Operating Expenses from the approximated Gross Profit.  Therefore, ₹17,388 million (Approximated Gross Profit) - ₹12,015 million (Operating Expenses) = **₹5,373 million**.  (This is also an approximation because cost of revenue was an approximation).

**Important Note:**  These figures for cost of revenue, gross profit, and operating income are approximations due to the way the income statement is presented in the annual report.  A precise calculation would require a more detailed breakdown of expenses.  Always refer to the original financial statements for precise figures.

### Bottom Line Metrics
Here are the values from Akzo Nobel India Limited's Standalone Financial Statements for FY2023-24 (in millions of Indian Rupees, except for EPS):

* **Net Income (Profit After Tax):** ₹4,267
* **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):**  This isn't explicitly stated but can be approximated. Start with Profit Before Tax (₹5,731 million), add back Depreciation and Amortization (₹823 million) and Finance Costs (₹125 million) to arrive at an approximate EBITDA of **₹6,680 million**.  This calculation assumes that other income and expenses, which may include non-operating items, are not included in EBITDA.
* **Basic EPS:** ₹93.70
* **Diluted EPS:** ₹93.70

Remember that these values are from the Standalone Financial Statements.  The Consolidated Financial Statements will show different figures due to the inclusion of the subsidiary's results.  The EBITDA figure is an approximation; for the precise figure, consult the company's detailed financial statements.



## Cash Flow
### Cash Flow Components
Based on Akzo Nobel India Limited's Standalone Statement of Cash Flows for FY2023-24 (in millions of Indian Rupees):

* **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** ₹4,859
* **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** ₹(860)  (The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow)
* **Cash Flow from Financing Activities:** ₹(4,394) (The negative sign indicates a net cash outflow)

Again, these are from the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows will have different values due to the inclusion of the subsidiary's cash flows.

### Cash Flow Metrics
Akzo Nobel India Limited's Annual Report doesn't explicitly present "Free Cash Flow" as a single line item.  However, we can approximate it using the information provided.

* **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** This is represented by "Payments for purchase of property, plant and equipment" in the Statement of Cash Flows: ₹1,185 million (This is a cash outflow).

* **Dividends Paid:** This is explicitly stated in the Statement of Cash Flows: ₹4,099 million (This is a cash outflow).

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Approximation:** A common way to calculate FCF is:  Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures.  Using the figures from the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows: ₹4,859 million - ₹1,185 million = **₹3,674 million**.  This is an approximation and doesn't include other potential adjustments some analysts might include in FCF calculations (like changes in working capital).  For a precise FCF, one would need to utilize a more complete and detailed calculation which is not explicitly available within the document provided.


It is important to remember that these are all based on the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows. Consolidated figures would differ.

### Profitability Ratios
Calculating precise profitability ratios requires a detailed income statement with all expenses explicitly categorized. The provided annual report doesn't provide this level of detail in all cases; approximations will be necessary.  These calculations are based on the Standalone Financial Statements for FY2023-24 and use approximated figures from previous responses, where necessary:

* **Gross Profit Margin:** (Approximated Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100
    * ₹17,388 million / ₹39,616 million * 100 = **~43.8%**  (Approximation)

* **Operating Profit Margin (EBIT Margin):** (Approximated Operating Income / Revenue) * 100
    * ₹5,373 million / ₹39,616 million * 100 = **~13.6%** (Approximation)


* **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) * 100
    * ₹4,267 million / ₹39,616 million * 100 = **~10.8%**

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** (Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity) * 100
    * To calculate average shareholder's equity, we need the previous year's value which is not clearly provided.  The report provides the ROE as **32.3%**.


* **Return on Assets (ROA):** (Net Income / Average Total Assets) * 100
    * Similar to ROE, this requires previous year's total assets which is not directly provided.  We therefore cannot calculate this precisely.


**Important Note:**  The gross profit margin and operating margin are approximations, as the calculation depends on our approximation of the cost of revenue and operating income from the data provided.  The ROE is taken from the report itself, as it's provided directly.  The ROA cannot be accurately calculated without additional data not provided in this report. Always refer to the original financial statements for the most accurate figures.

### Liquidity Ratios
To calculate these ratios, we'll use the figures from Akzo Nobel India Limited's Standalone Balance Sheet for FY2023-24 (in millions of Indian Rupees):

* **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
    * ₹19,209 million / ₹14,236 million = **1.35**

* **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):** (Current Assets - Inventories) / Current Liabilities
    * (₹19,209 million - ₹6,115 million) / ₹14,236 million = **0.92**

* **Cash Ratio:** (Cash and Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities
    * ₹2,730 million / ₹14,236 million = **0.19**

**Important Note:** These ratios are based on the Standalone Balance Sheet.  The Consolidated Balance Sheet would yield different results.  Also, the interpretation of these ratios should consider industry benchmarks and trends to determine whether the liquidity position is strong or weak for the company.  A low current ratio is a cause for concern in general, but the quick and cash ratios offer some context, indicating a weaker short-term liquidity position.

### Efficiency Ratios
Calculating these efficiency ratios accurately requires more detailed information than is readily available in the provided annual report.  Specifically, precise figures for Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and average inventory and receivables values across FY2023 and FY2024 are needed. We can provide approximations, but these must be interpreted cautiously.  All figures are in millions of Indian Rupees.


* **Asset Turnover:** Revenue / Average Total Assets
    * We need the previous year's total assets to calculate the average.  Therefore, we can't calculate this precisely.  The report provides some turnover ratios but not this one.

* **Inventory Turnover:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
    * We've approximated the Cost of Goods Sold as ₹22,228 million (see previous responses).  The average inventory would be (₹6,115 million + prior year's inventory)/2.  The prior year's inventory value isn't explicitly provided, rendering precise calculation impossible.  The report gives the inventory turnover ratio as **3.7x**.


* **Receivables Turnover:** Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable
    * We need the prior year's accounts receivable to calculate the average. Therefore, precise calculation isn't possible. The report gives the receivables turnover ratio as **7.0x**.


**In summary:** While the report provides some of these turnover ratios directly, the lack of detailed financial statement information prevents precise calculation of asset turnover.  The Inventory and Receivables Turnover ratios are taken directly from the report. Remember that these ratios are based on the standalone financial statements; consolidated figures would differ.



### Leverage Ratios
The calculation of use ratios requires careful consideration of how "debt" is defined within the context of Akzo Nobel India's financial reporting. The company doesn't present a single "total debt" figure.  The figures below are from the Standalone Financial Statements and are based on approximations where necessary, and should be interpreted with caution.  All amounts are in millions of Indian Rupees.


* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
    * Defining total debt is challenging.  We can approximate total debt using the sum of the non-current lease liabilities (₹451 million), other non-current financial liabilities (₹20 million), current lease liabilities (₹153 million), and other current financial liabilities (₹1,008 million).  This gives an approximate total debt of ₹1,632 million.
    * ₹1,632 million / ₹13,292 million = **~12.2%** (Approximation)

* **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** Total Debt / Total Assets
    * Using the approximated total debt from above:  ₹1,632 million / ₹29,030 million = **~5.6%** (Approximation)

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) / Interest Expense
    * EBIT can be approximated as ₹5,856 million (see previous responses). Interest expense is provided as ₹125 million (standalone).
    * ₹5,856 million / ₹125 million = **~46.8x**

**Important Considerations:**

* **Debt Definition:** The definition of "debt" used above is an approximation. A more precise calculation might include other financial liabilities not explicitly categorized as debt.
* **Standalone vs. Consolidated:** The above calculations are based on standalone figures.  Consolidated figures would incorporate the subsidiary's debt, altering the results.
* **Approximations:**  EBIT is an approximation, as are many of the components used in calculating the debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets ratios.

Therefore, always consult the company's detailed financial statements for precise figures and a complete picture of its leverage.  The interest coverage ratio is likely to be the most reliable of these three, given that interest expense is a clearly stated line item.



## Market Analysis
### Market Metrics
The annual report doesn't directly provide the market capitalization, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, or dividend payout ratio.  To calculate these, you'd need additional information not included in the report itself, such as the current market price of Akzo Nobel India's shares and the company's total number of outstanding shares.


However, we can calculate the **dividend yield** using the information available:

* **Dividend Yield:** (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price per Share) * 100

The annual dividend per share is ₹75.  To calculate the dividend yield, you need the current market price of the share, which is not included in the annual report.  You would need to obtain this from a financial data provider.


The **dividend payout ratio** also requires data not directly available in the annual report. The formula is:

* **Dividend Payout Ratio:** (Total Dividends Paid / Net Income) * 100

While the total dividends paid (₹4,099 million standalone) is available, the precise value for net income in the consolidated financial statements is required to calculate the ratio accurately.  A precise calculation would also depend on which measure of net income is used (standalone vs. consolidated) to calculate the ratio.


In short, the annual report provides the necessary dividend information for dividend yield calculation, but this calculation requires external market data. The dividend payout ratio is calculable if you wish to use standalone values for dividends paid and net income, but also needs the consolidated values for a truly precise calculation.  You would need to consult financial news sources or databases for the missing market data to fully answer this question.



## Business Analysis
### Segment Analysis
Akzo Nobel India's annual report doesn't provide precise data on market share for each segment or the geographic breakdown of revenues.  It's also important to remember that the provided numbers reflect standalone data, not consolidated, and so don't encompass the subsidiary's results.  The revenue growth rate is calculated using the standalone figures.

Here's a summary of available information on Akzo Nobel India's business segments:


| Segment Name                      | Revenue (₹ Million) | Revenue Growth Rate (%) | Operating Margin (%) | Key Products                                                                                     | Geographic Presence                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Decorative Paints                 | 38,517                | 4.2                       |  (Not explicitly stated but can be inferred as high due to overall profitability) | Dulux (interior & exterior, including Weathershield and Aquatech ranges), Sadolin (wood coatings) | Nationwide across 24 states, with presence in over 5,000 towns. |
| Automotive & Specialty Coatings | 600                   | (Not explicitly stated)    | (Not explicitly stated)  | Automotive OEM coatings, Consumer Electronics Coatings, Vehicle Refinishes, Specialty Coatings           | Nationwide across 45 distributors                |
| Powder Coatings                    | (Not explicitly stated)| (Not explicitly stated)    | (Not explicitly stated)  | Interpon, Resicoat                                                                               | Nationwide, expanding presence in Tier 2 and 3 cities |
| Marine & Protective Coatings      | (Not explicitly stated)| (Not explicitly stated)    | (Not explicitly stated)  | International brand protective coatings                                                                | Serving both domestic and export markets              |
| Industrial Coatings              | (Not explicitly stated)| (Not explicitly stated)    | (Not explicitly stated)  | Coil and Extrusion Coatings, Packaging Coatings, Wood Finishes & Adhesives                           | Nationwide, targeting infrastructure projects.      |


**Missing Information:**

The report lacks detailed segmental information, especially concerning:

* **Precise Revenue Figures:** Revenue for many segments is not individually specified in the standalone statements.
* **Operating Margins:** While the overall operating margin is high, segment-specific operating margins are not given.
* **Market Share Data:** The report does not include quantitative market share data for each segment.
* **Geographic Revenue Breakdown:** The report provides some indications of geographic reach but lacks a quantitative breakdown of revenue by region.

To obtain a complete picture of the segmental performance of the company, further research from external financial analysis sources would be necessary.  The limited information above should be interpreted cautiously.





## Risk Management
### Risk Assessment
Akzo Nobel India's annual report identifies many key risk factors, though it doesn't explicitly quantify the impact severity or likelihood using numerical scales. We can categorize and summarize them as follows:


| Risk Category        | Risk Description                                                                                                  | Impact Severity                               | Likelihood          | Mitigation Strategies                                                                                                                                            | Trends                                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operational Risks** | Occupational Hazards                                                                                             | High (potential for serious injury/fatality) | Moderate to High     | Strict HSES policies, employee training, risk assessments, safety protocols, proactive safety programs (BBS, Timeout for Gemba).                                         | Continued focus on safety improvements and compliance; increasing regulatory scrutiny.                                   |
|                      | Cybersecurity Attacks                                                                                           | High (financial loss, reputational damage)  | Moderate to High     | Cybersecurity awareness training, security assessments, robust IT infrastructure, incident response plan.                                                             | Growing sophistication of cyber threats; increased reliance on digital technologies.                     |
