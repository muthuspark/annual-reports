*Analysis:*

FY23-24 marked a significant operational upswing for Puravankara, with record sales value and volume, alongside robust customer collections. This indicates strong market demand and effective sales strategies. While realisation per square foot saw a modest increase, the substantial growth in volume drove overall revenue. The significant increase in net operating surplus highlights improved execution and inventory monetization. However, the net profit declined despite higher revenues, suggesting potential pressures from increased operating costs, higher finance costs prior to capitalization, or other unitemized expenses impacting the bottom line disproportionately. The company also achieved a significant reduction in debt per sq. ft of under-construction area. The current cost of debt stands at 11.59%. ICRA reaffirmed an 'A-' Stable credit rating.

### Business Segment Performance

Puravankara operates through distinct brands:

*   **Purva (Luxury Residences):** Represents 48% of the 14.04 msft launch pipeline (approx. 6.74 msft). Land assets for Puravankara brand stand at 31.82 msft, with 17.16 msft in ongoing projects and 35.41 msft completed.
*   **Provident (Premium Mid-Segment Housing):** Represents 52% of the 14.04 msft launch pipeline (approx. 7.30 msft). Land assets for Provident brand stand at 4.32 msft, with 14.51 msft in ongoing projects and 14.99 msft completed.
*   **Purva Land (Plotted Developments):** Represents a smaller portion of the launch pipeline, 0.09 msft.
*   **Starworth Infrastructure and Construction Limited (SICL):** Tech-driven EPC solutions. FY24 Turnover: ₹431.87 Cr, Profit After Tax (PAT): ₹(4.50) Cr. Contribution to consolidated PAT: (6.99%).
*   **Commercial Real Estate:** Developing approx. 3 msft.

#### Segment-wise Financials (Subsidiaries - FY23-24)

*   **Provident Housing Limited:** Turnover ₹466.35 Cr, PAT ₹29.55 Cr (70.36% contribution to consolidated PAT).
*   **Starworth Infrastructure & Construction Limited:** Turnover ₹431.87 Cr, PAT ₹(4.50) Cr (-6.99% contribution).
*   **T-Hills Private Limited:** Turnover ₹317.17 Cr, PAT ₹68.48 Cr (163.04% contribution).

*Analysis:*

Provident and Purva brands form the core of the residential development launch strategy. T-Hills Private Limited and Provident Housing were significant profit contributors in FY24, while Starworth posted a loss. The focus on plotted development via Purva Land caters to a specific investment and aspirational second-home market. The company has a diversified portfolio targeting various homebuyer segments.

### Major Strategic Initiatives and Progress

*   **Nationwide Expansion:**
    *   Strong presence in South India (Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai).
    *   Expanded to West India (Mumbai, Pune, Goa). Acquired land in Thane and residential redevelopment rights for two housing societies in Mumbai.
    *   Exploring Northern regions (Noida, Gurgaon) to achieve pan-India developer status.
*   **Capital Management & Funding:**
    *   HDFC Capital infused capital into Provident Housing for development.
