### Auditor's Opinion and Key Audit Matters

*   **Opinion:** Unqualified opinion issued on both Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, indicating a true and fair view in conformity with Ind AS and the Companies Act, 2013.
*   **Key Audit Matters (KAMs):**
    *   **Valuation of Inventory:** Highlighted due to the inherent risk in accurately valuing closing stocks and the volatility in prices of key raw materials. Auditor procedures included reviewing stock records, management discussions, and verifying valuation calculations.
    *   **Allowance for Trade Receivables / Credit Losses:** Significant due to the large value of receivables and the judgment required in estimating recoverability using the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model. Auditor procedures included understanding the estimation process, testing subsequent settlements, and evaluating the basis for overdue receivables assessment.

### Accounting Policies and Quality Analysis

*   **Basis:** Financial statements prepared under Ind AS on a going concern and historical cost basis, except for specific financial instruments measured at fair value. Functional and presentation currency is INR.
*   **Key Policies:**
    *   *Revenue Recognition:* Recognized upon transfer of control of goods/services to customers, measured at transaction price net of discounts/returns. Percentage-of-completion method used for certain fixed-price contracts.
    *   *Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) & Intangibles:* Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment. Depreciation/amortization is on a Straight-Line Method (SLM) based on useful lives aligned with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
    *   *Inventories:* Valued at the lower of cost (FIFO for raw materials/stores; absorption costing for WIP/finished goods) and net realizable value (NRV).
    *   *Financial Instruments:* Classified and measured based on business model and cash flow characteristics (Amortised Cost, FVTOCI, FVTPL). Trade receivables are assessed for impairment using the ECL model (simplified approach).
