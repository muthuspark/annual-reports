*   **Operational Excellence & Digitization:** Emphasis on timely deliveries, scalable infrastructure, and process management, enhanced by digitization initiatives such as unique QR codes on garments for 100% traceability, inventory, and quality control.

### Company Overview and Business Model

Pearl Global Industries Limited (PGIL), established in 1987, is a global apparel multinational specializing in design, manufacturing, and supply chain solutions for the fashion industry. The company caters to a diverse clientele, including major international brands and retailers such as Kohl's, PVH, Inditex, and GAP. PGIL operates with a diversified product portfolio encompassing knits, wovens, denim, outerwear, activewear, and athleisure.

Its manufacturing footprint spans 10 countries (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Guatemala, US, Spain, Hong Kong, UK, UAE) with 24 manufacturing units (including partnership facilities), boasting an annual capacity of 83.9 million units.

The company emphasizes customized solutions, a robust design team (75 designers globally), operational rigor, and sustainable practices.

### Financial Performance Review (FY 2023-24 - Consolidated)

Consolidated revenue from operations reached ₹3,436.15 Crores, a 9% year-on-year (YoY) increase from ₹3,158.41 Crores in FY 2022-23. This growth was significantly driven by a 21% YoY increase in overseas revenue, particularly from Bangladesh and Vietnam facilities.

#### Profitability
*   EBITDA (excluding ESOP expenses) crossed the ₹300 Crores mark, amounting to ₹307.8 Crores, a 22% YoY growth from ₹258.2 Crores.

#### Geographical Revenue Contribution
Bangladesh (46%), India (20%), Vietnam (14%), Indonesia (10%), Others (10%). (Shipped Pieces %)

#### Client Concentration
69% of revenue contribution came from key clients, indicating strong relationships but also a degree of concentration risk.

#### Credit Rating
ICRA upgraded the long-term credit rating to A- (Stable) from BBB+ (Stable), reflecting consistent performance despite market slowdowns and benefits from a multinational presence.

#### Cashflow Risk
Asset-light model optimizes capital, operations funded through internal resources, and focus on timely collections.

Monitored, with diversification across manufacturing locations acting as a natural hedge.

#### Operational Risk (Supply Chain, Energy, Safety - from BRSR)
*   Supply Chain: Adherence to OCS, GOTS for traceability and organic content.

## Financial Analysis: Pearl Global Industries Limited (FY 2023-24)

### Auditor's Opinion and Qualifications

S.R. Dinodia & Co. LLP issued an unmodified opinion on the Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, signifying a true and fair view in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.

Key Audit Matters (KAMs):

*   Adequacy and completeness of disclosures of Related Party Transactions.
*   Recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosures of revenues as per Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.

The consolidated financial statements' report includes an "Other Matters" paragraph, relying on other auditors' reports for six subsidiaries (total assets ₹140,840.53 lakh, total revenues ₹369,686.40 lakh for FY24).

The Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2020 (CARO) report noted:

*   The audit trail (edit log) facility at the database level was not enabled for the accounting software.
*   The accounting software used for payroll records did not have an audit trail feature.

A similar observation was made in the consolidated CARO report.

### Key Accounting Policies

The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value, in accordance with Ind AS. Key accounting policies include:

*   **Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):** Revenue recognized when control of goods or services is transferred.
*   **Leases (Ind AS 116):** Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed on a straight-line basis.
*   **Financial Instruments (Ind AS 109):** Financial assets are classified at amortized cost, FVTOCI, or FVTPL. Financial liabilities are generally measured at amortized cost. Hedge accounting is applied for certain derivative contracts (cash flow hedges).
*   **Inventories:** Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average/FIFO for traded goods) and net realizable value.
*   **Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE):** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is primarily on a straight-line basis.
*   **Employee Benefits (Ind AS 19):** Defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans are accounted for using the projected unit credit method. ESOP costs are recognized based on fair value at grant date.
*   **Business Combinations and Goodwill (Ind AS 103):** Accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.

No new standards or amendments materially impacted the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024.

### Internal Control Effectiveness

The auditors' report on Internal Financial Controls (IFC) under Section 143(3)(i) states that the Holding Company and its Indian subsidiaries have an adequate IFC system over financial reporting.

However, the CARO report points to deficiencies in the audit trail functionality for certain accounting software.

### Regulatory Compliance Status

*   **Companies Act, 2013:** General compliance confirmed. The CARO observation on audit trail functionality is a compliance point under Rule 11(g).
*   **SEBI Regulations:** Compliance confirmed with SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.
*   **Listing Requirements:** Listing fees for FY 2024-25 have been paid.
*   **FEMA:** Compliance reported for Foreign Direct Investment, Overseas Direct Investment, and External Commercial Borrowings.
*   **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG):** Compliance and initiatives related to National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) outlined in the BRSR.
*   **Tax Laws:** Ongoing tax assessments and pending litigations exist.

Overall, broad compliance is reported, with the audit trail deficiency noted for improvement.

### Legal Proceedings and Their Potential Impact

As per Note 46 on Contingent Liabilities:

*   **Tax Demands:** Income Tax demands are pending for Assessment Years 2011-12, 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2020-21.
*   **Labor Cases:** Various legal cases involving labor are pending.

    *   Consolidated: Irrevocable LCs outstanding: ₹17,144.32 lakh (FY24), ₹15,295.05 lakh (FY23).

No significant and material orders were passed by regulators or courts impacting the going concern status or future operations.
