*   International Business Revenue: Grew 8% (4% in constant currency).
*   Non-Branded Business Revenue: Grew 9%.
*   Consolidated EBITDA: Flat YoY, significantly impacted by India tea margin pressure.
*   Profit Before Tax (PBT) (Before Exceptional): Declined 20% YoY, impacted by EBITDA performance and higher interest costs (though improving).
*   Group Net Profit: INR 287 crores (down 6% YoY reported, INR 282 crores mentioned by CFO).
*   Margins: Consolidated EBITDA margin flat YoY. Significant margin pressure in India Tea due to ~25-30% higher tea costs YoY. International business saw strong profitability growth (35% YoY). Non-branded EBIT margin expanded 180 bps YoY.

### Comparison:

*   Strong top-line growth momentum continued, especially on an organic basis (9%) compared to previous quarters.
*   India tea volume growth (7%) was a multi-quarter high.
*   EBITDA performance was weaker compared to the strong growth seen in previous quarters (e.g., 11% YTD growth), primarily due to the Q3 intensification of tea cost pressures.
*   Management noted that excluding the tea cost/price impact, underlying EBITDA margins would have expanded by 75-100 bps.
    *   Quote: *"Assuming India Tea margins were at the Q3 FY'24 level, our overall EBITDA margin for the quarter would have expanded at least 75 to 100 bps."*

### Guidance/Forecasts:

*   No explicit revision to overall guidance.
*   Expectation that tea margin pressure will continue for the next 1-2 quarters (Q4 FY'25, Q1 FY'26) until the new crop arrives, although Q3 FY'25 likely represented the peak impact delta.
    *   Quote: *"We do expect this pressure to continue till probably end of Q1, early Q2 until the new flush comes in..."* and *"I think Q3 would be the peak of the pressure [on margins]."*
*   Expect acceleration in Capital Foods and Organic India growth in Q4 FY'25.
    *   Quote: *"Capital Foods and Organic continue to build momentum, and we expect Q4 to have a very good acceleration from here on."*

### Growth/Decline Areas:

## Market & Competitive Landscape

### Industry Trends:

*   Significant tea cost inflation (~25-30% YoY).
    *   Quote: *"tea prices, which are about 25% to 30% higher than last year."*
*   Extremely high coffee prices ("40, 50-year high").
    *   Quote: *"Coffee... 40, 50-year high in terms of prices."*
*   Shift towards e-commerce (15% of TCPL sales, higher than Modern Trade at 14%).
*   Urban market showing strength when Modern Trade and E-commerce are included.
    *   Quote: *"If I add back modern trade... and e-commerce... then my urban growth also is close to double digits."*
*   Growth in Fruit & Herbal / Specialty Tea in the UK.

### Competitive Positioning:

*   Maintaining competitiveness in Tea despite cost pressure, focusing on volume and long-term share over short-term margin.
    *   Quote: *"remain focused on building long-term competitiveness."* and *"will remain competitive. I will drive volume and value growth, yes?"*
*   Strong market share gains in Salt (+110 bps MAT).
*   Corrected competitiveness issues in RTD via pricing/margin adjustments, leading to volume recovery.
    *   Quote: *"Ready-to-drink business, we had issues with competitiveness last quarter, which we have corrected, and it delivered double-digit volume growth."*
*   #1 Tea player in Canada, #2 in UK. Maintaining #1 position in India e-commerce for tea.
*   Partnership with PepsiCo (Kurkure) for Ching's Schezwan Chutney sampling/co-branding to grow the category.
    *   Quote: *"by partnering with Kurkure, we've got the Schezwan Chutney flavor with the Ching's bottle on the pack..."*

### Market Challenges/Opportunities:

*   **Challenges:** High tea/coffee costs impacting margins, competitive intensity in RTD, potential demand softness due to high commodity prices (esp. coffee), managing acquisition integration smoothly.
*   **Opportunities:** Gaining share from unorganized/local players in Tea due to cost pressure, leveraging expanded distribution network, scaling up growth platforms (Sampann, Soulfull, RTD, acquisitions), significant runway for Capital Foods/Organic India, driving growth in Food Service/Pharma channels, premiumization (value-added salt, specialty tea), K-Cups in the US.

### Market Share Comments:

*   Salt: +110 bps MAT gain.
*   Tea: "minor movement," Nielsen data shows narrowing gap in GT, stable in MT, #1 in e-commerce (not included in Nielsen total). Management implies share gain given 7% volume growth vs likely lower industry growth.
    *   Quote: *"I absolutely think so [opportunity to gain share from local players]. Because, Abneesh, I don't think industry has grown 7% volume right?"*
*   UK: #2 overall tea player, Fruit & Herbal share at 10%.
*   Canada: #1 overall tea player (~27% share).
*   US: Market share started trending up in the last 2 months of the quarter.

## Risk Factors & Challenges

### Acknowledged Concerns:

*   Significant India Tea margin pressure due to high costs and only partial (~40%) price pass-through.
    *   Quote: *"probably compensated for about 40% of the tea price increase. The 60% is still out there."*
*   Uncertainty around future tea and coffee prices.
    *   Quote: *"If you can tell me where coffee prices are going to go, I can promise to tell you the margins."*
*   Competitive actions in the RTD
