I'm a software engineer based in Bangalore, India, with a passion for technology and investing. Let me tell you a bit about my journey and why I built this site.

## My Story

* **Tech + Finance = ‚ù§Ô∏è**  
  While coding keeps my brain buzzing during the day, analyzing stocks and reading annual reports is my after-hours adventure. Been riding the stock market waves since 2006!

* **The Annual Report Challenge**  
  Let's be honest - annual reports can be like trying to read War and Peace in a day. They're packed with valuable information but are often longer than your favorite Netflix series.

* **The Hunt for Good Analysis**  
  I used to spend hours searching for good annual report summaries online. Sometimes I'd strike gold, other times... not so much. Especially for the less popular companies, finding good analysis was like finding a needle in a haystack.

## Why I Built This Site

* **Trying out my AI knowledge**  
  Instead of waiting for others to analyze reports, I thought, "Why not build something that does this automatically?" So I combined my love for coding with cutting-edge AI technology to create this annual report analyzer.

  Whenever companies drop their annual reports, my tool jumps into action. It's like having a tireless financial analyst working 24/7.

* **Making Financial Data Digestible**  
  The goal is simple: turn those lengthy reports into clear, actionable insights that don't require a PhD in Finance to understand.

## My Investment Philosophy

* **Research First**  
  I believe in understanding a business thoroughly before investing. Annual reports are like a company's report card - they tell you the real story.

* **Long-Term Thinking**  
  Quick profits are nice, but building wealth through informed, patient investing is the real game.

* **Continuous Learning**  
  The market is always evolving, and so should we. Every annual report is a new opportunity to learn something valuable.
