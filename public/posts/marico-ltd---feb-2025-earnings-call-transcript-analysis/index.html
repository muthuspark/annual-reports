<p>Proactively addressing GT sluggishness via &ldquo;Project SETU&rdquo; (extended to 11 states), segregating packs, MOP implementation, and easing working capital pressure for distributors. Aiming for differential growth in urban/premium portfolios via organized retail and e-commerce. Alternate channels (MT, E-comm incl. Quick Commerce) are key growth drivers (~30% salience).</p>

<p>FMCG sector shows &ldquo;reasonably steady demand.&rdquo; Rural improving (&ldquo;growing at 2x suburban&rdquo;) driven by government schemes, MSPs, good crops.

</h3>
<p>Marico claims over 90% of its business gained/sustained market share (MAT). Parachute gained share &amp; penetration. Saffola Oats maintained #1 position. VAHO gained value share but facing &ldquo;unreasonable competition&rdquo; via &ldquo;disproportionately unsustainable BTL&rdquo; in the BoP segment. Management explicitly stated, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to compete with [this] because we believe in long term equity building.&rdquo; Foods market seen as having high growth potential despite competition due to low penetration; Saffola brand equity seen as key advantage. Plix navigating a &ldquo;crowded&rdquo; personal care space via differentiated &lsquo;skin/hair food&rsquo; positioning and D2C focus.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="market-challengesopportunities">
  Market Challenges/Opportunities

<p>Key challenge is navigating input cost inflation and its impact on margins and consumer demand (especially BoP). GT channel sluggishness is another major challenge being addressed. Opportunity lies in continued rural recovery.</p>
