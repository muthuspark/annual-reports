<p>Network People Services Technologies Limited (NPST) has articulated a strategic framework, &ldquo;NPST 2.0,&rdquo; aimed at transitioning the company from a mid-sized entity to a large enterprise. This strategy is founded on three pillars: Innovate, Transform, and Grow. FY24 marked a period of significant financial achievement, with the company reporting record revenue growth for the third consecutive year, surpassing INR 1,300 million (INR 130 crore), a 210% organic year-on-year increase. This performance exceeded guidance on revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted earnings per share. The company&rsquo;s net profit surged by 309.66% to INR 26.71 crore, and EBITDA grew by 253% to INR 43.7 crore. The company also completed a 2:1 bonus share issue and secured a position among India&rsquo;s top 1,000 listed companies by market capitalization. Management emphasizes a focus on prudent capital allocation and efficient execution.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="revenue-analysis--growth-drivers">
  Revenue Analysis &amp; Growth Drivers
  <a class="anchor" href="#revenue-analysis--growth-drivers">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Revenue growth was driven by expansion in the banking segment, where NPST doubled its client base, and significant expansion of its Payments Platform as a Service (PaaS) business through integration with Payment Aggregators (PAs) and Payment Gateways (PGs). The company also diversified into the offline payments market with Qynx, recognizing that the largest transaction volumes still occur in-store.</p>
<p>Key performance drivers include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Product and Platform Expansion:</strong> Introduction of new products like Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) and Instant Merchant Refund on UPI, and enhancements to existing platforms like EvoK 2.0 and the UPI Plugin.</li>
<li><strong>New Lines of Business:</strong> Strategic entry into the offline payment market with Qynx.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthened Business Capabilities:</strong> Organizational restructuring into Technology Service Provider (TSP) and PaaS business lines, coupled with key leadership appointments.</li>
</ol>
<p>The business model includes a license model (one-time cost, AMC, change requests, manpower support) and a SaaS model (per transaction, per month, per user login) for its TSP vertical, alongside hardware product sales.</p>

<p>EBITDA margin improved from 30.10% in FY23 to 33.59% in FY24. Net Profit Margin also saw a significant increase, from 15.85% in FY23 to 20.53% in FY24. This indicates enhanced operational efficiency and cost management alongside strong revenue growth. The increase in Operating Profit Margin (21.44% to 27.76%) is attributed to a rise in EBIT. The company’s ability to exceed guidance on adjusted operating margin further underscores effective cost control and value capture.</p>
