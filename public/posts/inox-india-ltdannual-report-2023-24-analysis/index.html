</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Environment:</strong> Sustained demand for Standard Storage Tanks and Micro-bulk units in India, Middle-East, North &amp; South America, and Europe. Engineered Tanks &amp; System packages (including Flat Bottom Tanks, large non-Cryo equipment) saw demand from India, Middle East, and Far East Asia. Steel production increase in India (target 230 MT by 2030-31) is expected to boost demand for Air Separation Plants and related cryogenic equipment. Investments in industrial gas, hydrogen liquefaction, and semiconductor industries are driving EPC demand.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Secured large contract for PETRONAS ZLNG project. Consistent orders for Standard Tanks (Americas, Middle-East, India) and LCO2 tanks (Africa, Middle-East). Micro-bulk units gained business in India and exported to Americas, Australia, Middle-East. Semi-Trailer orders from South-East Asia, Middle-East, South America, Australia, including a FOIK LN2O Trailer. Designed, manufactured, and erected 311 M3 Liquid Hydrogen tank in South Korea for mobility application. Kandla SEZ Plant achieved record revenue of ₹335 Crore.</li>

<h4 class="heading" id="lng-division">
  LNG Division
  <a class="anchor" href="#lng-division">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Environment:</strong> LNG prices stabilized, remaining above historical averages due to limited production capacity. Global LNG demand projected to rise to 625-685 million MT by 2040, driven by coal-to-gas switching in Asia. USA became the largest LNG producer. LNG played a crucial role in European energy security. Domestically, India&rsquo;s LNG imports rose. NITI Aayog report supports LNG for transport, aligning with India&rsquo;s goal of 15% natural gas in energy mix by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements (Export):</strong> Set new benchmark in Brazil with large fleet of 61 M3 LNG Semi-Trailers for On-Road distribution. Supplied a 560 M3 LNG Marine Fuel Gas Tank (one of the largest from Kandla Works) to a European shipyard for a Japanese cruise vessel. Supplied LNG Storage Tanks for Liquefaction Plants in Americas, including an order from a large private US Space Agency. Completed equipment supplies for Antigua mini LNG Terminal (4 X 1000 M3 Storage Tanks), expected commissioning May-June 2024. Increased footprint in Central America and Caribbean by commissioning several LNG Satellite Stations.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements (Domestic):</strong> Secured majority share for LNG Fueling Stations from private and public sector companies; commissioned 6 LNG Dispensing Stations. Won key orders for LCNG Stations and commissioned several for CGD companies. Secured orders for LNG fuel tanks from automobile OEMs as LNG-fueled truck trials completed. Supplied LNG Fuel Tanks for MSRTC&rsquo;s pilot project to convert diesel buses to LNG. Signed Mutual Support Agreement with Adani Total Gas Limited to strengthen LNG ecosystem.</li>

<h4 class="heading" id="cryoscientific-division">
  Cryoscientific Division
  <a class="anchor" href="#cryoscientific-division">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Environment:</strong> Growing global focus on renewable energy and nuclear fusion (ITER). Cryogenics (Liquid Helium) vital for superconducting magnets in fusion. Demand for cryo-distribution in atomic acceleration research (Cryolines, Feedboxes, Cryomodules). Defence applications (AIP systems for submarines requiring LOX). Medical applications (MRI machines – India largely imports).</li>
<li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Received challenging project from ITER Organisation for vacuum vessel thermal shield repair work (5 of 9 sectors awarded). Received 2 first orders from Wroclaw University, Poland for FAIR Project, Germany (Feedboxes, Current lead boxes). First order from L&amp;T Defence for LOX tank for AIP system in Kalvari submarines. First order from MTAR Technologies for high-pressure kerosene tank for rocket engine testing. Ongoing ITER Project cryo/warm lines installation (approx. 80% complete, 100% in Cryoplant building). Continuous business from ITER/CERN, including special orders for impregnation chamber (CERN) and Multi Process Cryolines (ITER).</li>

<h4 class="heading" id="other-businesses">
  Other Businesses
  <a class="anchor" href="#other-businesses">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disposable Refrigerant Cylinders:</strong> Low demand initially due to US anti-dumping case; orders resumed in Q4 FY24 post favorable initial USDOC report. Strong domestic demand.

  Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion and Qualifications
  <a class="anchor" href="#auditors-opinion-and-qualifications">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The Independent Auditors&rsquo; Reports on both Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, provide an unqualified opinion. The auditors state that the financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone Financial Statements:</strong> No qualifications are noted. A Key Audit Matter (KAM) identified is &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts recognized over time&rdquo; due to significant management judgment involved in estimating percentage completion and contract margins based on actual costs incurred and forecasted future costs.</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated Financial Statements:</strong> No qualifications are noted. The same KAM, &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts recognized over time,&rdquo; is identified. An &ldquo;Other Matter&rdquo; paragraph highlights that the financial statements of two foreign subsidiaries, reflecting total assets of ₹5,929.32 lakhs and total revenues of ₹6,442.43 lakhs, were not audited but were certified by management. These are stated as not material to the Group. The auditors&rsquo; opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.</li>

<h4 class="heading" id="key-accounting-policies-and-changes">
  Key Accounting Policies and Changes
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-accounting-policies-and-changes">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The company has consistently applied its material accounting policies during the financial year 2023-24. No new standards or amendments notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) were applicable to the company for this financial year that would necessitate a change in accounting policies.</p>
<h5 class="heading" id="key-accounting-policies-include">
  Key accounting policies include:
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-accounting-policies-include">#</a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):</strong> Revenue from contracts is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. For obligations satisfied over time (a significant portion, particularly for long-term projects), progress is measured using the input method (proportion of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost). This involves significant estimation for total contract costs and revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (PPE) and Intangible Assets:</strong> Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment. The company elected to use previous GAAP carrying amounts as deemed cost on Ind AS transition. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over useful lives prescribed by Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, or based on technical assessment for certain assets.</li>
<li><strong>Leases (Ind AS 116):</strong> Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized for leases. Short-term leases and low-value asset leases are expensed on a straight-line basis.</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average for raw materials, stores &amp; spares; includes material, labor, and overheads for finished goods &amp; WIP) and net realizable value.</li>
