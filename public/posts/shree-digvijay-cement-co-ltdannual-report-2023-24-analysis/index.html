</h3>
<p>Shree Digvijay Cement Company Limited (SDCCL) reported record financial performance for FY 2023-24, achieving its highest-ever EBITDA, PBT, and PAT. This marks a significant turnaround from its loss-making history, attributed to enhanced operational efficiencies, cost control, and increased sales volumes, particularly in blended and special products. Key strategic initiatives include a capacity expansion project targeting 3.00 MTPA by Q4 FY25, guided by a capital allocation philosophy focused on Free Cash Flow (FCF) generation and evaluating build vs. buy options to minimize balance sheet burden. The company maintains a debt-free status and strong liquidity. Key risks revolve around input costs (fuel, power, raw materials), market competition, regulatory compliance, and execution of the expansion project.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity Expansion:</strong> The primary strategic focus is expanding cement capacity to 3.00 MTPA via a new grinding unit at the Sikka plant. The project is underway and expected to commission in Q4 FY25.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Allocation:</strong> Management emphasizes FCF generation and prudent capital allocation. The expansion aims for low capital cost, potentially through evaluating &lsquo;buy&rsquo; opportunities if cheaper than &lsquo;build&rsquo;, challenging conventional self-reliance models in the industry.</li>
<li><strong>Market Outlook:</strong> The company anticipates robust demand driven by government infrastructure focus (NIP, Gati Shakti, Housing for All), increased private capex, and India&rsquo;s low per capita cement consumption. The Indian economy is projected to maintain strong growth (RBI: 7% for FY25).</li>

<p>The auditors&rsquo; reports on both Standalone and Consolidated financials contain a modification regarding compliance with Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014. Specifically, the auditors noted deficiencies in the audit trail (edit log) feature of the accounting software:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was not enabled at the database level for certain fields/tables.</li>
<li>It was not enabled at the application layer for privileged user access for a portion of the financial year (April 1, 2023, to February 7, 2024).</li>
</ul>
<p>This constitutes a non-compliance with specific record-keeping requirements under the Companies Act rules, although it did not lead to a qualification on the overall truth and fairness of the financial statements themselves.</p>
