  Executive Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#executive-summary">#</a>
</h3>
<p>UCO Bank demonstrated a mixed financial performance in FY2024. While operating profit and total income showed growth, net profit declined due to higher provisions and operating expenses, particularly staff costs. The Bank maintained healthy growth in advances and deposits, with a notable improvement in asset quality, reflected in reduced Gross and Net NPA ratios and an enhanced Provision Coverage Ratio. Capital adequacy remains strong. Strategic initiatives focused on digital transformation, customer service enhancement, and strengthening key lending segments like Retail, Agriculture, and MSME. The Bank&rsquo;s outlook is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging global economic challenges but emphasizing domestic resilience and strategic initiatives for sustainable growth.</p>
