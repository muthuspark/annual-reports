</h4>
<ul>
<li>Revenue from operations (Sale of Energy) declined by 12.81% in FY24, primarily attributed to lower generation due to flash floods and reduced water inflow. Total income saw a marginal decrease of 1.24%.</li>
<li>PBT and PAT decreased by 11.38% and 2.34% respectively in FY24. The higher PAT decline relative to PBT decline suggests changes in effective tax rates or regulatory income adjustments.</li>
<li>Net Worth and Other Equity continued their growth trajectory, up by 5.25% and 7.33% respectively, indicating retained earnings and value accretion.</li>
<li>A significant increase of 17.70% in CWIP to â¹29,794.72 crore highlights aggressive capital expenditure on ongoing projects.</li>
<li>Long-term borrowings increased by 4.29%, supporting the capex. The Debt-Equity ratio remained stable and healthy at 0.84.</li>
<li>Dividend per share increased to â¹1.90, indicating a consistent shareholder return policy. The total dividend payout for FY24 will be â¹1,908.55 crore (51% of PAT).</li>
<li>EBITDA remained relatively stable with a slight decrease of 0.17%.</li>

<p>NHPC Limited reported a standalone Profit After Tax (PAT) of â¹3,743.94 crore for FY 2023-24, a slight decrease from â¹3,833.79 crore in FY 2022-23. Consolidated net profit stood at â¹4,028.01 crore compared to â¹4,260.83 crore in the previous year.</p>
<p>Total standalone income for FY 2023-24 was â¹10,024.99 crore, marginally down from â¹10,150.90 crore in FY 2022-23. Revenue from Operations (standalone) amounted to â¹8,404.92 crore in FY24, compared to â¹9,316.34 crore in FY23. This decline was primarily attributed to lower energy sales.</p>
<p>Sale of Energy (standalone) decreased by 12.79% to â¹7,327.90 crore in FY24 from â¹8,404.65 crore in FY23, mainly due to reduced generation and a decrease in sales pertaining to earlier years. Incentive income also fell to â¹457.81 crore from â¹675.68 crore. The average selling price (adjusted) was â¹4.21/unit for 19,138 MU sold in FY24, up from â¹3.97/unit for 21,622 MU in FY23.</p>
<p>Other Operating Income (standalone) increased significantly by 201.45% to â¹379.68 crore, largely due to interest from beneficiary states on revised tariffs. Other Income (standalone) also rose by 94.12% to â¹1,620.07 crore, buoyed by higher dividend income (â¹497.54 crore), income from insurance claims (â¹381.92 crore), and realization of business interruption loss (â¹149.86 crore).</p>

<p>Total generation across NHPC&rsquo;s standalone power stations was 21,779 Million Units (MUs) in FY24, down from 24,907 MUs in FY23. This included 21,615 MU from hydro, 72 MU from wind, and 92 MU from solar. The overall Plant Availability Factor (PAF) for FY24 was 77.60%, compared to 88.75% in FY23. The normative PAF for FY24 was 77.35%.</p>
<p>The decrease in generation was attributed to flash floods in Himachal Pradesh (July 2023) and Sikkim (October 2023), and overall lower water inflow. Despite this, six power stations met their annual design energy targets, and ten achieved their normative PAF.</p>
<p>Renovation &amp; Modernization of the 105 MW Loktak Power Station is underway, with an approved DPR cost of â¹273.59 crore (Sept 2017 PL), aiming to increase design energy from 448 MU to 562.73 MU.</p>

<p>NHPC Limited reported a mixed financial performance for the fiscal year 2023-24. On a standalone basis, Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at â¹3,743.94 crore, a slight decrease from â¹3,833.79 crore in the previous year. Total standalone income also saw a marginal decline to â¹10,024.99 crore from â¹10,150.90 crore in FY23. Revenue from Operations (standalone) was â¹8,404.92 crore, down from â¹9,316.34 crore in the prior year. This decrease in operational revenue and PAT is primarily attributed to lower generation. Consolidated Net Profit was â¹4,028.01 crore compared to â¹4,260.83 crore in FY23, on a consolidated total income of â¹10,898.78 crore (FY23: â¹11,509.09 crore).</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s Net Worth (standalone) increased to â¹37,268.61 crore as of March 31, 2024, from â¹35,407.96 a year earlier. EBITDA (standalone) remained relatively stable at â¹5,733.88 crore against â¹5,743.43 crore in FY23. However, the EBITDA margin (standalone) improved to 68.22% from 61.65%, likely due to changes in the revenue mix or cost management efficiencies despite lower generation.</p>
<p>The Board has recommended a final dividend of â¹0.50 per equity share, which, combined with the interim dividend of â¹1.40 per share, results in a total dividend of â¹1.90 per share for FY24. This amounts to a total payout of â¹1,908.55 crore, representing approximately 51% of standalone PAT and 5.12% of standalone Net Worth, adhering to the company&rsquo;s dividend distribution policy.</p>
<p>Key financial ratios indicate a stable financial structure. The Debt-Equity Ratio (standalone) was 0.84 as of March 31, 2024, compared to 0.85 in the previous year. The Return on Net Worth (standalone) decreased to 10.30% from 11.13% YoY, reflecting the dip in profitability. The Price to Earning (PE) ratio saw a significant increase to 24.03 from 10.52, driven largely by the appreciation in market price per share. Interest Service Coverage Ratio (standalone) improved to 3.16 from 3.01.</p>

<p>NHPC&rsquo;s power stations generated a total of 21,779 Million Units (MUs) during FY24, a decrease from 24,907 MUs in FY23. The overall Plant Availability Factor (PAF) was 77.60%, down from 88.75% in the previous year. The reduction in generation and PAF was attributed to flash floods in the Himachal region in July 2023, unprecedented flash floods from Lhonak Lake affecting the Teesta Basin projects in October 2023, and generally lower water inflows. Despite these challenges, six power stations achieved their annual design energy targets, and ten power stations met their normative PAF. Parbati-II HE Project (800 MW) commenced infirm power generation.</p>
<p>Significant progress was made on key under-construction projects. The Subansiri Lower HE Project (2000 MW) saw the installation of Spillway Radial Gates Nos. 7, 8, and 9, with three units expected to be commissioned by March 2025 and all units by May 2026. The foundation stone for India&rsquo;s largest hydroelectric project, the 2880 MW Dibang Multipurpose Project, was laid, and Dirki Nalla diversion was completed, ensuring all-weather road access. Lanco Teesta Hydro Power Limited (LTHPL - Teesta Stage-VI, 500 MW) and Jalpower Corporation Limited (JPCL - Rangit-IV, 120 MW) projects, being executed by wholly-owned subsidiaries, achieved physical progress of 61.63% and 72.65% respectively. Projects under CVPPL (Pakal Dul, Kiru, Kwar) and RHPCL (Ratle) also reported ongoing construction activities.</p>
