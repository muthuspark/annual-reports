<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> OCF significantly increased to ₹264.22 crores in FY24 from ₹153.18 crores in FY23. This improvement is primarily driven by higher Profit Before Tax (PBT) and favorable movements in operating expenses despite some adverse working capital changes (increase in receivables).</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> OCF remained relatively stable at ₹120.31 crores in FY24 compared to ₹119.50 crores in FY23. Higher PBT was offset by significant negative working capital adjustments, particularly increased trade receivables.</li>

<li><strong>Standalone:</strong> Net cash used in financing activities was ₹178.16 crores in FY24, a significant outflow compared to ₹6.10 crores used in FY23. This was mainly due to repayment of short-term borrowings (net outflow of ₹68.00 crores vs net inflow in FY23), lease liability payments (₹79.39 crores), and dividend payment (₹18.01 crores).</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated:</strong> Net cash generated from financing activities was ₹159.23 crores in FY24 (FY23: ₹30.73 crores). This was driven by proceeds from borrowings (net ₹52.83 crores), offsetting lease payments (₹97.64 crores) and dividend payment (₹18.01 crores).</li>

<li><strong>Receivables:</strong> Standalone Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio decreased slightly from 5.46x to 5.06x, indicating a marginal increase in the collection period. Consolidated receivables also increased.</li>
<li><strong>Payables:</strong> Standalone Trade Payables Turnover Ratio decreased marginally from 4.50x to 4.31x, suggesting a slight extension in the payment cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> Inventory levels remain minimal relative to turnover, consistent with the asset-light logistics model. Standalone Inventory Turnover Ratio decreased significantly, although inventory is not a core operational driver.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):</strong> Calculation is limited by the lack of clear Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) data typical for a service industry. However, the increase in receivables relative to payables suggests potential elongation of the CCC.</li>

A declining trend might indicate asset base growing faster than revenue, possibly due to acquisitions.</li>
<li>Inventory Turnover Ratio: Decreased sharply to 1.00x in FY24 from 7.64x in FY23 (Standalone). This indicates slower movement or changes in the nature of inventory held, though inventory is a minor part of the overall business.</li>
<li>Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio: Decreased to 5.06x in FY24 from 5.46x in FY23 (Standalone), suggesting a slight slowdown in collections or changes in credit terms. Consolidated receivables increased to ₹701.90 crores from ₹652.49 crores.</li>

The Board of Directors oversees this framework, with implementation through a dedicated Risk Management Committee (RMC). Policies and processes address risk identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring across financial, operational, sectoral, sustainability (ESG), information, and cybersecurity domains. The RMC, comprising a majority of Independent Directors, reviews the framework, evaluates risks associated with business operations (including acquisitions), and monitors mitigation plans, reporting adequacy, and effectiveness, reporting to the Board. Internal financial controls are assessed annually, involving management, internal auditors, external consultants, and statutory auditors. The Board deemed internal financial controls adequate and operating effectively for FY24, based on these reviews. Statutory Auditors provided an unmodified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of internal financial controls over standalone financial statements.</p>
