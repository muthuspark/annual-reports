<li>FY 2023: -1.58% (Net Loss: Rs. 42.58 Lakhs)</li>
</ul>
<p>The company reported a higher net loss in FY24 compared to FY23. This was primarily due to lower operating profit and the absence of the deferred tax credit benefit seen in FY23.</p>

  Operating Leverage

<p>The Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) was approximately 18.21 (-56.08% / -3.08%).</p>
<p>The high positive DOL indicates significant operating leverage. A small decrease in revenue (-3.08%) led to a much larger decrease in EBIT (-56.08%). This suggests a high proportion of fixed costs in the operating structure.</p>

<p>Net OCF significantly increased to INR 159.44 Lakhs in FY24 from INR 82.35 Lakhs in FY23. Despite a higher loss before tax (INR -88.04 Lakhs vs INR -61.23 Lakhs), the improvement was driven by larger positive adjustments for non-cash items (Depreciation, Finance costs) totaling INR 488.77 Lakhs (vs INR 471.21 Lakhs) and a smaller negative impact from working capital changes (INR -229.07 Lakhs vs INR -326.55 Lakhs).

Key components include higher purchases of Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (PPE) at INR 59.02 Lakhs (vs INR 28.50 Lakhs) and a significantly smaller inflow from the decrease in Non-Current Loans (INR 18.96 Lakhs vs INR 123.50 Lakhs).

<p>Net FCF outflow increased to INR 449.54 Lakhs in FY24 from INR 394.21 Lakhs in FY23. Major outflows included repayments of long-term borrowings (INR 136.98 Lakhs), principal payments on lease liabilities (INR 119.68 Lakhs), interest on lease liabilities (INR 103.40 Lakhs), and finance costs paid (INR 84.21 Lakhs).

<h3 class="heading" id="working-capital-management-efficiency">
  Working Capital Management Efficiency

<p>Efficiency metrics indicate some deterioration. The Inventory Turnover Ratio decreased from 6.78 times in FY23 to 5.41 times in FY24 (-20.25%), suggesting slower inventory movement.</p>
<p>The Debtor Turnover Ratio slightly decreased from 57.81 times to 55.88 times (-3.34%), indicating marginally slower collection of receivables.</p>
<p>The Current Ratio declined from 0.92 to 0.83, remaining below 1, pointing towards potential stress in meeting short-term obligations.</p>
<p>Despite increased operational losses, OCF improved due to better management of working capital changes compared to the prior year.</p>

  Capex Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#capex-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Capital expenditure (Purchase of PPE including CWIP and Intangible Assets) increased to INR 59.02 Lakhs in FY24 from INR 28.50 Lakhs in FY23, as per the cash flow statement.</p>
<p>Additions to Gross Block of PPE were INR 97.71 Lakhs in FY24 (vs INR 32.93 Lakhs in FY23). Additions to Right-of-Use Assets were INR 50.59 Lakhs (vs INR 369.96 Lakhs).</p>
<p>The company operates under a single reportable segment: Manufacturing and Trading of Bakery &amp; Confectionery Products. Therefore, capex analysis is not broken down by segment. Investments appear focused on maintaining and potentially expanding operational assets, including owned and leased properties (stores/factory).</p>

  Debt Service Coverage

</h3>
<p>The company&rsquo;s ability to service debt appears strained. The Interest Coverage Ratio deteriorated further into negative territory, moving from (0.39) in FY23 to (0.47) in FY24. This indicates that earnings before interest and taxes were insufficient to cover interest expenses in both years.</p>
<p>The Debt Equity Ratio improved significantly from 0.73 to 0.49 (-33.04%), primarily due to the repayment of borrowings (long-term and lease liabilities). However, negative profitability limits debt servicing capacity.</p>

<p>The company&rsquo;s liquidity position weakened considerably during FY24. Cash and cash equivalents decreased sharply from INR 338.98 Lakhs at the start of the year to INR 11.92 Lakhs at year-end.</p>
<p>The Current Ratio remained below 1, decreasing from 0.92 to 0.83, suggesting potential difficulty in covering short-term liabilities with short-term assets.</p>
<p>A precise Cash Conversion Cycle cannot be calculated from the provided data. However, the decline in Inventory Turnover Ratio suggests a potential lengthening of the cycle, while the slight decrease in Debtor Turnover Ratio also contributes marginally.</p>

<p>The improvement in FCF despite increased net losses is attributed to stronger OCF generation, primarily from working capital management.</p>

  Long-term Strategic Goals and Progress
  <a class="anchor" href="#long-term-strategic-goals-and-progress">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dangee Dums aims to expand its product range, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, invest in innovation and product development, expand market presence, and pursue business excellence. Key strategic priorities include enhancing brand strength through product innovation and market presence, investing in own digital platforms while maintaining presence on third-party ones, and potentially exploring General Trade (GT) and Modern Trade (MT) distribution for Consumer Products Group (CPG) items. Sustainability is also a focus.</p>
<p>Progress in FY23-24 includes opening a new outlet (reaching 45 stores across 4 cities), expanding/transforming 18 stores into gourmet format and 2 into Store in Store format, launching new affordable products (puffs, sandwiches), introducing a new signature ice-cream range, and relaunching the family pack ice-cream. The transition to an &ldquo;Operator Model&rdquo; for store management, initiated in FY22-23, was extended into FY23-24 based on reported successful results in streamlining operations and improving financial outcomes. Despite these initiatives and achieving a turnover of Rs. 2,599.66 Lakhs, the company reported a net loss of Rs. 88.04 Lakhs, indicating significant challenges in achieving profitable growth during the year.</p>

  Competitive Advantages and Market Positioning
  <a class="anchor" href="#competitive-advantages-and-market-positioning">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dangee Dums positions itself as a well-known name in Gujarat for quality cakes, pastries, and bakery products, aiming to democratize consumption of high-quality items. Stated competitive advantages include strong brand recognition within Gujarat, a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility (25,000 sq ft) designed for efficiency, stringent quality control processes (shelf-life, hygiene, packaging, temperature control, traceability, compliance), and its own refrigerated logistics fleet with GPS tracking. The company emphasizes its customer feedback mechanisms (in-house CRM, &lsquo;Voice of Customer&rsquo; program) and its dedicated management team. The shift towards an Operator model is presented as an advantage offering flexibility, performance-based remuneration, and reduced costs. Its CPG division aims to leverage attractive packaging and convenient form factors.</p>

  Innovation Initiatives and R&amp;D Effectiveness
  <a class="anchor" href="#innovation-initiatives-and-rd-effectiveness">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The company emphasizes investment in product development, reporting a surge in sales across various categories (ice cream, ready-to-eat, beverages, chocolates, etc.) as a result. Specific innovations in FY23-24 (building on FY22-23 launches) include the expansion of affordable puff and sandwich offerings across all outlets, introduction of a new signature ice-cream range, and relaunching the family pack ice-cream range with new flavors and packaging. The CPG division continues to expand with chocolates, cookies, and khari, with plans to explore further western dessert categories. R&amp;D focuses on consumer trends, new product launches, core product renovation, healthier options, and affordability. The report cites positive reception for new launches like puffs and sandwiches. However, the overall financial loss suggests that R&amp;D and innovation efforts have not yet translated into overall profitability.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="managements-track-record-in-execution">
  Management&rsquo;s Track Record in Execution
  <a class="anchor" href="#managements-track-record-in-execution">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Management executed store expansion, reaching 45 outlets, and continued product diversification with launches in savory and CPG categories. The strategic shift to an Operator Model for store management was implemented and extended, cited as improving financial outcomes and streamlining operations. Management actively tracks customer feedback and monitors competition. However, the company incurred a substantial net loss of Rs. 88.04 Lakhs despite achieving Rs. 2,599.66 Lakhs in revenue from operations. This indicates significant challenges in managing costs, improving margins, or successfully navigating market difficulties, impacting the overall assessment of execution effectiveness during the fiscal year. The Chairman&rsquo;s message acknowledges the financial difficulties faced.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="capital-allocation-strategy">
  Capital Allocation Strategy
  <a class="anchor" href="#capital-allocation-strategy">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Capital allocation appears focused on organic growth initiatives. Investments were made in expanding the store network (opening one new store, renovating/transforming 20 existing ones), product development and R&amp;D, maintaining and operating a dedicated logistics fleet, and developing proprietary digital platforms (website/app). The Cash Flow Statement indicates capital expenditure on Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (Rs. 110.74 Lakhs) and repayment of borrowings (Rs. 328.82 Lakhs) and lease liabilities (principal Rs. 186.17 Lakhs). Due to the net loss, no dividend was recommended, conserving capital. The Auditor&rsquo;s Report notes that funds raised on a short-term basis (Rs. 23.48 Lakhs) were used for long-term purposes. The Debt-Equity ratio improved from 0.73 to 0.49, primarily due to debt repayment.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="organizational-changes-and-their-impact">
  Organizational Changes and Their Impact
  <a class="anchor" href="#organizational-changes-and-their-impact">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There were changes in Board composition: Mr. Umang Saraf ceased to be an Independent Director upon tenure completion, and Mr. Atulkumar Patel was appointed as an Independent Director. There was also a change in Key Managerial Personnel, with Ms. Twinkle Chheda replacing Mrs. Nilam Makwana as Company Secretary &amp; Compliance Officer. A significant operational change was the continued implementation and extension of the Operator Model for stores, replacing the previous employee-operated system. The company states this model offers advantages like flexibility, performance-based pay, enhanced marketing, improved financial outcomes, and reduced recruitment costs, contributing positively to operations and profitability, although overall company results were negative. The Internal Complaints Committee under the POSH Act was reconstituted.</p>
