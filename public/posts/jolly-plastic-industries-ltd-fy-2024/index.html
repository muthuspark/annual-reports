  <meta property="og:description" content="Overview # Comprehensive Analysis # This analysis examines Jolly Plastic Industries Limited’s (JPIL) Annual Report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.
I. Financial Performance:
JPIL’s financial performance shows a decline in profitability compared to the previous year.
Revenue: Sales/Income from operations decreased from ₹3,853,669 in FY2022-23 to ₹3,662,207 in FY2023-24, indicating a contraction of approximately 5%. This decline is not explained in detail within the report. Profitability: Profit before tax fell significantly from ₹174,735 to ₹97,000, a decrease of 44%. Profit after tax dropped even more dramatically from ₹129,304 to ₹72,587, a reduction of 44%. This significant drop suggests potential issues within cost management or sales strategies, warranting further investigation. Expenses: Total expenses decreased slightly from ₹3,678,934 to ₹3,565,207, but the reduction wasn’t substantial enough to offset the revenue decline. A detailed breakdown of expenses is needed to identify specific areas of cost increase or inefficiency. Dividend: The board did not recommend any dividend for FY2023-24, likely reflecting the reduced profitability. Other Key Metrics: The report lacks crucial financial ratios (e.g., gross profit margin, net profit margin, return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio) which are essential for a complete financial assessment. The provided financial statements are incomplete, making a thorough analysis impossible without further information. The report mentions a qualification by the statutory auditor regarding the absence of audit trails in the accounting software, raising concerns about the reliability of the financial data. II.

  Comprehensive Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#comprehensive-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This analysis examines Jolly Plastic Industries Limited&rsquo;s (JPIL) Annual Report for the fiscal year 2023-24, covering financial performance, business segments, risks, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>I. Financial Performance:</strong></p>
<p>JPIL&rsquo;s financial performance shows a decline in profitability compared to the previous year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Sales/Income from operations decreased from ₹3,853,669 in FY2022-23 to ₹3,662,207 in FY2023-24, indicating a contraction of approximately 5%.  This decline is not explained in detail within the report.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong> Profit before tax fell significantly from ₹174,735 to ₹97,000, a decrease of 44%.  Profit after tax dropped even more dramatically from ₹129,304 to ₹72,587, a reduction of 44%. This significant drop suggests potential issues within cost management or sales strategies, warranting further investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Total expenses decreased slightly from ₹3,678,934 to ₹3,565,207, but the reduction wasn&rsquo;t substantial enough to offset the revenue decline. A detailed breakdown of expenses is needed to identify specific areas of cost increase or inefficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend:</strong> The board did not recommend any dividend for FY2023-24, likely reflecting the reduced profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Other Key Metrics:</strong> The report lacks crucial financial ratios (e.g., gross profit margin, net profit margin, return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio) which are essential for a complete financial assessment.  The provided financial statements are incomplete, making a thorough analysis impossible without further information. The report mentions a qualification by the statutory auditor regarding the absence of audit trails in the accounting software, raising concerns about the reliability of the financial data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Business Segments:</strong></p>
<p>The annual report indicates that JPIL operates within a single segment: trading in shares, financial services, and investment activities.  There is no further breakdown provided of specific products or services within this segment.  The lack of segmental reporting limits the understanding of JPIL&rsquo;s business diversification and risk exposure.  The report mentions diversification into other areas such as third-party product distribution and originating unsecured personal/corporate loans, but doesn&rsquo;t quantify their contribution to overall revenue or profitability.</p>
<p><strong>III. Risks and Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>The report identifies several risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates pose a risk to the value of financial instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> Increased competition in local and overseas markets is a concern.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Risk:</strong> Unfavorable economic developments could dampen growth.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Risks:</strong> Risks associated with the company&rsquo;s accounting software (lack of audit trails) pose a significant concern regarding data reliability.  This is a significant governance and control risk.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Changes in government regulations and tax regimes could significantly impact operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report mentions a Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) case, which was resolved in the company&rsquo;s favor.  However, further information about the nature of the case and its potential impact is needed.</p>
<p><strong>IV. ESG Initiatives (Environmental, Social, and Governance):</strong></p>
<p>The report states that JPIL is not required to comply with Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013, relating to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).  This is likely due to the company not meeting the eligibility criteria for mandatory CSR spending.  However, the report lacks any disclosure regarding voluntary ESG initiatives, such as environmental sustainability efforts, diversity and inclusion programs, or ethical business practices.  This omission represents a significant gap in the report, as increasing investor focus on ESG performance necessitates greater transparency.  There&rsquo;s no mention of a whistleblower policy beyond the simple statement of its existence.</p>
<p><strong>V. Corporate Governance:</strong></p>
<p>The report details the composition of the board of directors and its committees (Audit, Nomination and Remuneration, Stakeholder Relationship).  However, it lacks specifics on the independence and expertise of the board members, and the effectiveness of the committees. The significant drop in profitability requires a more detailed explanation and analysis from the board, including strategic responses to address the decline.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>JPIL&rsquo;s 2023-24 annual report presents a concerning picture.  The significant drop in profitability and the auditor&rsquo;s qualification regarding the accounting software raise serious concerns.  The lack of detailed financial metrics, segmental reporting, and specific ESG disclosures limits the assessment of the company&rsquo;s overall health and long-term prospects.  The report needs significant improvement in transparency and detail to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the company&rsquo;s performance and risks.  Investors should seek clarification on the reasons behind the profitability decline and demand enhanced disclosure on risk management and ESG initiatives.</p>

</h3>
<p>The provided financial statements are incomplete and lack the necessary detail to accurately extract those specific values.  The Balance Sheet is partially filled, and crucial line items are missing or represented by dashes (&quot;-&quot;).  Therefore, it&rsquo;s impossible to determine the total assets, current assets, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and inventory values from the information given.  To obtain these figures, a complete and correctly filled Balance Sheet is required.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liability-analysis">
  Liability Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#liability-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Just like with the assets, the provided financial statements are incomplete, making it impossible to definitively determine the total liabilities, current liabilities, long-term debt, and accounts payable.  Several lines on the liability side of the balance sheet are either blank or show dashes (&quot;-&quot;), indicating missing data.  A complete and accurately filled balance sheet is needed for a proper calculation of these values.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="equity-analysis">
  Equity Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#equity-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report provides some, but not all, of the necessary information to answer this question completely.  Here&rsquo;s what we can determine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Share Capital:</strong>  The report clearly states that the equity share capital as of March 31, 2024, was ₹66,764,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> The Statement of Changes in Equity shows retained earnings (within &ldquo;Other Equity&rdquo;) as (₹896,673) at March 31, 2024.  The negative value indicates accumulated losses rather than accumulated profits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shareholders&rsquo; Equity:</strong> The balance sheet shows total shareholders&rsquo; equity as ₹68,567,327 as of March 31, 2024. This is comprised of Share Capital and Other Equity (which includes the negative retained earnings).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  It&rsquo;s crucial to understand that the negative retained earnings are a significant indicator of the company&rsquo;s financial health.  This combined with the incomplete financial statements raises serious concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the reported figures.  Further information is needed to conduct a thorough financial analysis.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="income-statement">

<h3 class="heading" id="operating-performance">
  Operating Performance
  <a class="anchor" href="#operating-performance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The income statement provided is also incomplete, making it impossible to accurately calculate all the requested figures.  While some values are present, crucial components like Cost of Revenue are missing (represented by dashes &ldquo;-&rdquo;).  Therefore, we cannot determine the cost of revenue, gross profit, or operating income with certainty.  The revenue is given as ₹3,662,207,  but without the cost of revenue, we cannot calculate gross profit or operating income. A complete income statement is necessary for accurate calculation.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="bottom-line-metrics">
  Bottom Line Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#bottom-line-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Based on the provided financial statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Net Income:</strong> The Profit &amp; Loss account shows a net profit of ₹72,587 for the year ended March 31, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):</strong>  We cannot calculate EBITDA because the income statement does not provide the necessary components (interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).  Depreciation and Amortization are absent from the provided statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic EPS (Earnings Per Share):</strong> The Profit &amp; Loss account shows a basic EPS of ₹0.0011.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> The Profit &amp; Loss account indicates that the diluted EPS is the same as the basic EPS (₹0.0011).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The extremely low net income and EPS figures are a significant cause for concern, highlighting the company&rsquo;s weak financial performance.  The absence of several key components in the financial statements limits a full and reliable analysis.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="cash-flow">
  Cash Flow

</h2>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-components">
  Cash Flow Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-components">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The Cash Flow Statement provided is partially complete, making a precise determination of the operating, investing, and financing cash flows impossible.  While some figures are present, many sections contain dashes (&quot;-&quot;) representing missing information.  Therefore, we cannot reliably calculate any of these cash flow components.  A complete and accurately filled Cash Flow Statement is necessary for accurate figures.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="cash-flow-metrics">
  Cash Flow Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We cannot determine the free cash flow, capital expenditure, and dividends paid from the provided information.  The cash flow statement is incomplete, lacking key details on capital expenditures and other relevant items.  Additionally, the report explicitly states that no dividends were paid.  To calculate free cash flow (typically operating cash flow less capital expenditures), we need complete and accurate data from the cash flow statement and balance sheet.</p>

</h2>
<h3 class="heading" id="profitability-ratios">
  Profitability Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#profitability-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to calculate the profitability ratios (gross margin, operating margin, net profit margin, ROE, ROA) due to the incomplete financial statements provided in the annual report.  The necessary components for these calculations—Cost of Revenue, Operating Expenses, interest expense, and several others—are either missing or presented incompletely.  Therefore, any calculation would be unreliable and inaccurate.  Complete and correctly presented financial statements are necessary to calculate these key performance indicators.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="liquidity-ratios">
  Liquidity Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#liquidity-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Due to the incomplete nature of the balance sheet,  it&rsquo;s impossible to accurately calculate the liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio).  The balance sheet has numerous missing values, preventing the calculation of the current assets, current liabilities, and other necessary components needed for these ratios.  A complete and correctly filled balance sheet is essential for reliable calculations.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="efficiency-ratios">
  Efficiency Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#efficiency-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>We cannot calculate the efficiency ratios (asset turnover, inventory turnover, receivables turnover) because the necessary data is missing from the provided financial statements.  The incomplete income statement and balance sheet lack key figures like Cost of Goods Sold, accounts receivable, and inventory values.  To compute these ratios, complete and accurate financial statements are required.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="leverage-ratios">
  Leverage Ratios
  <a class="anchor" href="#leverage-ratios">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Calculating leverage ratios (debt-to-equity, debt-to-assets, interest coverage) is impossible due to the incomplete financial statements. The balance sheet lacks crucial information on total debt and equity.  The income statement is missing interest expense data.  Therefore, reliable calculation of these ratios is not possible.  Complete and accurate financial statements are required.</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="market-metrics">
  Market Metrics
  <a class="anchor" href="#market-metrics">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report does not contain market capitalization data or share price information, which are essential for calculating the PE ratio (Price-to-Earnings), PB ratio (Price-to-Book), dividend yield, and dividend payout ratio.  While the basic EPS is provided,  the lack of share price prevents the calculation of PE and PB ratios.  Furthermore, no dividends were paid, resulting in a zero dividend yield and a zero dividend payout ratio.  To calculate these market-based metrics, access to current market data (share price and number of outstanding shares) is required, beyond what&rsquo;s included in the annual report.</p>

<p>The annual report only mentions that Jolly Plastic Industries Limited operates in a single business segment: trading in shares, financial services, and investment activities.  It does <em>not</em> provide a breakdown of this segment into sub-segments or any details about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific names for sub-segments:</strong> No sub-segments are identified within the &ldquo;trading in shares, financial services, and investment activities&rdquo; segment.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue by sub-segment:</strong> No revenue figures are allocated to specific sub-segments within the overarching segment.</li>
<li><strong>Growth rates by sub-segment:</strong>  No growth rate data is provided for any sub-segments.</li>
<li><strong>Operating margins by sub-segment:</strong> No operating margin information is broken down by sub-segment.</li>
<li><strong>Market share by sub-segment:</strong> No market share data is offered for any potential sub-segments.</li>
<li><strong>Key products by sub-segment:</strong>  The report doesn&rsquo;t list specific products or services offered within each hypothetical sub-segment.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic presence by sub-segment:</strong> The report only mentions operations within India. No regional or geographic breakdown within the country is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the provided annual report lacks the necessary detail to describe the business segments beyond the general statement of the primary segment&rsquo;s activities.  This lack of granular information significantly hinders a comprehensive understanding of the company&rsquo;s operational structure and performance.</p>

<p><strong>Missing Information:</strong> The report lacks specifics on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact Severity and Likelihood:</strong> The assessment of &ldquo;High,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moderate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;High&rdquo; is subjective and needs quantitative data to support it.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>  The listed mitigation strategies are general.  The report lacks details on specific actions undertaken or planned.</li>
<li><strong>Trends:</strong>  The assessment of trends is vague.  More detailed analysis of industry trends and the company&rsquo;s competitive positioning is necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, while the report identifies several key risks, it falls short in providing the necessary detail to thoroughly evaluate the severity, likelihood, mitigation efforts, and trends associated with each risk factor. A more comprehensive risk assessment with quantitative data is needed for a robust understanding of the company&rsquo;s risk profile.</p>

  Management Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#management-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report offers limited insight into management&rsquo;s key strategies, competitive advantages, market conditions, challenges, and opportunities.  Here&rsquo;s a summary based on the available, fragmented information:</p>
<p><strong>Key Strategies (Inferred):</strong></p>
<p>The report suggests a focus on enhancing shareholder value through sound business decisions, prudent financial management, and high ethical standards.  It mentions diversification into various financial services, but specifics are lacking.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Advantages (Not Explicitly Stated):</strong></p>
<p>The report doesn&rsquo;t explicitly identify any specific competitive advantages.  Implicitly, strong ethical standards and prudent financial management are suggested as positive attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Market Conditions (Partially Described):</strong></p>
<p>The report touches upon increasing income levels leading to greater penetration of financial products and positive regulatory reforms as potential opportunities.  It also highlights inflation, increased competition, and unfavorable economic developments as potential threats.  However, a comprehensive overview of the market conditions is absent.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profitability Decline:</strong> The significant drop in profitability in FY2023-24 is a major challenge, though the underlying reasons are not adequately explained.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong>  Intense competition in financial services markets is a significant challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Uncertainty:</strong>  Macroeconomic factors and inflation pose a risk to the business.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing Financial Services Market:</strong> Increasing income levels present opportunities for expanding financial product penetration.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Reforms:</strong> Positive regulatory changes can create new business opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong> The annual report offers a very limited and superficial description of management&rsquo;s perspective on strategic direction, competitive positioning, and the market landscape.  More detail is needed to understand their strategic vision, how they intend to overcome challenges, and exploit opportunities. The lack of specific strategic initiatives makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of management&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-ratings">
  ESG Ratings
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-ratings">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The provided annual report does not include any ESG ratings from any rating agencies.  There is no mention of any ESG initiatives, voluntary or otherwise, nor any reference to external assessments of the company&rsquo;s ESG performance.  To obtain ESG ratings, you would need to consult independent ESG rating providers such as MSCI, Sustainalytics, Refinitiv, etc., and search for JPIL&rsquo;s ratings from those sources.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="esg-initiatives">
  ESG Initiatives
  <a class="anchor" href="#esg-initiatives">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The annual report does <em>not</em> provide any information regarding Jolly Plastic Industries Limited&rsquo;s (JPIL) environmental initiatives, carbon footprint, social initiatives, governance practices beyond a basic description of board committees, or sustainability goals.  The report explicitly states that the company is not subject to mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013.  This lack of disclosure is noteworthy, given the increasing importance of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors in investment decisions.  Without further information from JPIL or independent sources, a comprehensive assessment of their ESG performance is not possible.</p>

<p>The annual report states that R&amp;D expenditure is NIL.  It also does not provide the total employee count.  More detailed information would be needed to obtain these figures.</p>

<p>The only significant event explicitly mentioned in the annual report is the resolution of a Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) case in the company&rsquo;s favor.  The report does not provide specifics about the nature of the case or its potential impact on the company&rsquo;s operations or financials beyond the outcome.  No other significant events are detailed.  A more thorough review of the company&rsquo;s disclosures beyond the annual report would be needed to capture all relevant events.</p>

<p>The auditor&rsquo;s opinion is unqualified.  The auditors, GAMS &amp; Associates LLP, state that the standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the company&rsquo;s financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2024, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other generally accepted accounting principles in India.  However, a qualification is noted regarding the accounting software&rsquo;s lack of audit trail functionality.</p>
<p>The key accounting policies outlined in the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong>  The financial statements are prepared using the historical cost convention and accrual basis, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India, applicable Ind AS, and the Companies Act, 2013.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Estimates:</strong> Management uses estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):</strong>  The company reports no PPE.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation:</strong> No depreciation is charged due to the absence of PPE.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory:</strong> The company reports no inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Investments:</strong> The company reports no investments.</li>
<li><strong>Classification of Assets and Provisioning:</strong>  The report mentions adherence to Non-Banking Financial Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions 1998 for asset classification and provisioning.  Specific details are not provided.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition and Accrual of Expenses:</strong> Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.  All expenses are accrued.</li>
<li><strong>Taxes on Income:</strong> Provisions for current and deferred income tax are made according to the Income Tax Act, 1961, and applicable tax rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to note that the absence of significant assets (PPE, Inventory) and the auditor&rsquo;s qualification regarding the accounting software raise concerns about the reliability and completeness of the financial information presented.  The details of several policies, such as asset classification and provisioning, are insufficient.</p>
