  Observations
  <a class="anchor" href="#observations">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Revenue demonstrated strong growth at 18.44%, driven primarily by staffing services, particularly in consumer, telecom, retail, e-commerce, and manufacturing sectors due to increased formalization.</li>
<li>EBITDA grew by 7.0%, though the EBITDA margin contracted by approximately 15 bps. This margin pressure is attributed to pricing pressures from large clients and macroeconomic headwinds, despite efforts towards economies of scale and value-added services.</li>
<li>PAT growth was marginal at 0.99%, indicating that while top-line growth was robust, increased costs or pricing pressures significantly impacted bottom-line expansion.</li>
<li>The phase-out of the NEEM program impacted the Degree Apprenticeship business numbers initially but was mitigated by a focus on other apprenticeship schemes, achieving net positive headcount growth by Q4 FY24.</li>
<li>IT Staffing continued to face headwinds, mitigated by a strategic shift towards Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and product companies, which offer higher margins albeit lower volumes.</li>
</ul>

<p>TeamLease Services Limited reported consolidated revenue from operations of â¹9,321.53 crores for FY2024, an 18.44% increase from â¹7,870.00 crores in FY2023. Consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) stood at â¹112.66 crores, a marginal increase from â¹111.55 crores in the previous year. EBITDA (before exceptional/non-business expense) grew by approximately 7% YoY to â¹131 crores. Despite revenue growth, overall margin compression was observed, attributed to pricing pressures and macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in the IT staffing segment. The company maintained a strong balance sheet with free cash flow of â¹265 crores and a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 36%. A share buyback was concluded during the year.</p>

  Market Position and Competitive Landscape
  <a class="anchor" href="#market-position-and-competitive-landscape">#</a>
</h3>
<p>TeamLease positions itself as one of India&rsquo;s leading human resource service companies, having facilitated employment for over 2.3 million individuals since its inception. The company aims to be the largest private sector employer in India and the largest staffing company globally by headcount. Key value drivers include a base of 3,20,000 associates/trainees and over 3,800 clients.</p>
<p>The staffing industry, particularly general staffing, is seeing growth driven by formalization in sectors like consumer and manufacturing. However, this growth, especially with large clients, exerts pressure on Per Associate Per Month (PAPM) revenue and consequently, margins. The IT staffing segment continues to face headwinds from the broader IT industry slowdown, mitigated by a strategic focus on Global Capability Centres (GCCs). The company faces competition from regional players in blue-collar staffing and emerging digital-first staffing platforms.</p>

<p>This segment was the predominant driver of headcount growth, with a net incremental associate growth of approximately 35,000 (20% YoY net growth). Strong performance was noted in consumer, telecom, retail, e-commerce, and manufacturing sectors. The company is focusing on economies of scale, value-added services, and a strategic client mix, including a shift towards variable mark-up models with new, smaller clients to sustain margins. Hiring costs are approximately â¹2,200 per associate.</p>

However, a focus on higher-margin GCC clients helped maintain revenue run-rates. Measures include headcount rationalization and cost optimization, with a goal to recover to an 8% EBITDA margin.</p>
