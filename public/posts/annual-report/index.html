<p>Despite significant interest rate adjustments by central banks aimed at restoring stability in pricing, the global economy has shown resilience. Projections indicate continued worldwide economic growth at a rate of 3.2% for both 2024 and 2025, in line with the momentum of 2023. While advanced economies are expected to experience a slight increase in growth from 1.6% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025, there will be a modest deceleration in emerging market and developing economies, stabilising at 4.2% growth for both 2024 and 2025, following a commendable 4.3% in 2023.</p>
<p>Looking ahead five years, the global growth forecast remains steady at 3.1%, indicating overall stability. Inflation is predicted to gradually decrease globally, declining from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. Advanced economies are expected to reach their inflation targets sooner than emerging markets and developing economies. However, core inflation is projected to decline at a measured pace overall.</p>

<p>There is a growing expectation for the Indian economy to achieve a growth rate of 7% or higher for FY24, with forecasts even suggesting continued growth at this level for FY25. Such sustained growth, if realised, would mark the fourth consecutive year post-pandemic that the Indian economy has demonstrated resilience, exceeding the 7% threshold. This achievement underscores the robustness and potential of the Indian economy, presenting promising opportunities for its future trajectory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the global economy grapples with challenges in maintaining its post-Covid recovery amidst successive disruptions. Notably, supply chain disruptions have resurfaced in 2024, threatening to impact trade flows, transportation costs, economic output and global inflation. While these disruptions pose challenges, India, having adeptly navigated the adversities of the pandemic and previous energy and commodity price shocks in 2022, maintains a cautious confidence in its ability to navigate through emerging disturbances.</p>

<p>Globally, the market for SS flexible hose was estimated to value at approximately USD 25 billion in 2020 with the size of SS corrugated hose estimated at USD 12.5 billion which is slated to grow to USD 38 billion and USD 18 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 7.5% and 6.3%, respectively. Supported by favourable product attributes, the demand for SS flexible hoses is being driven by rapid urbanisation which has accelerated the pace of the infrastructure developments and real estate construction that has triggered the demand of HVAC systems and translated in promising outlook for SS flexible hoses. Moreover, large scale industrialisation and modernisation in agriculture and key manufacturing sectors is fuelling the demand for SS corrugated hose (industrial hoses).</p>
<p>Industry sources suggest that the piping industry accounts for the largest market share amongst all end users while Asia Pacific accounted for the largest share of the global stainless steel flexible hose market followed by North America. In coming years too, driven by healthy economic growth in China and India, Asia Pacific is expected to grow at the highest CAGR.</p>
<p>Rising infrastructure spending and focussed government initiative to curb carbon emission and push clean energy is expected to drive the growth of flexible flow solutions made with SS corrugation from many key end user industries such as electric automobile, renewable water heating application and other energy efficient electrical appliances. While progress on factory automation for operational optimisation and cost control in the manufacturing sector is believed to have a positive impact on flexible flow solutions made with SS corrugation too.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the demand for flexible flow solutions made with stainless steel corrugation was largely driven by the industrial sector - manufacturing plants and manufacturing products from chemicals to paper. HVAC applications too were a major consumer, although the scale of business generated by this segment was lower compared to its industrial counterpart. The steady growth in industrial activity amidst some disruption along with the slow but steady transition from rubber/ PTFE/polymer flexible hoses have resulted in a favourable demand landscape for flexible flow solutions made with SS corrugation manufacturers.</p>
<p>With flexible flow solutions made with SS corrugation application being universal, this large base is believed to have supported a strong demand for the product. The transition from traditional flexible hoses too has accelerated the demand growth.</p>
<p>Given the increasing preference for flexible flow solutions made with SS corrugation in place of rubber/ PTFE/polymer hoses, the demand for the former from the industrial sector would be stable. This development would help in creating a stable user base for flexible flow solutions made with SS corrugation, thus ensuring there is always a steady demand for the product.</p>
<p>However, the coming years would witness demand from sectors which are either at its infancy or yet to establish itself in India. The emergence of these new user segments would help immensely expand the addressable market for the product. Notable sectors which would create new demand include renewables (primarily solar heating), Lithium-Ion battery applications (EV as well as other battery applications), semiconductor manufacturing, and robotics.</p>

</h2>
<p>The Holding Company&rsquo;s management and Board of  Directors  is  responsible  for  the    matters  stated  in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in terms of  the requirements of the act, that give a true and fair view of the Consolidated state of affairs, Consolidated profit &amp; loss including Consolidated other comprehensive income, Consolidated  cash  flows  and  Consolidated  changes  in equity of the Group in accordance the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act.</p>
<p>The  respective  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  of the  companies  included  in  the  Group  are  responsible for maintenance  of  adequate  accounting  records  in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application of  appropriate  accounting  policies;  making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.</p>

  AUDITORS&rsquo; RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  <a class="anchor" href="#auditors-responsibilities-for-the-audit-of-the-consolidated-financial-statements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors&rsquo; report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p>As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error, as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal control.</li>
<li>2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for  expressing  our opinion  on  whether  the  entity  has  adequate  internal financial  controls  system  in  place  and  the  operating effectiveness of such controls.</li>
<li>3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related  disclosures  made  by  Management  and Board of Directors.</li>
<li>4 Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  Management&rsquo;s and  Board  of  Directors  use  of  the  going  concern basis  of  accounting  in  preparation  of  Consolidated Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors&rsquo; report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors&rsquo; report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.</li>
<li>5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and  whether  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.</li>
<li>6 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  within  the Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements.  We  are  responsible  for  the direction,  supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit of the financial statements of such entities included in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  which we  are  the  independent  auditors&rsquo;.  We  remain  solely responsible  for  our  audit  opinion.  We  communicate</li>
</ul>
<p>with  those  charged  with  governance  of  the  Holding Company and such other Companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For the other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors&rsquo;, such other auditors&rsquo; remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.</p>
<p>We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors&rsquo; regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal control that we identify during our audit.</p>
<p>We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.</p>
<p>From the matters communicated with those charged with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors&rsquo; report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.</p>

</h2>
<p>A  Company&rsquo;s  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company&rsquo;s internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Company;</li>
<li>2 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and</li>
<li>3 Provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&rsquo;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</li>

<p>explanatory information (together hereinafter referred to as &rsquo; Consolidated Financial Statements &lsquo;).</p>
<p>The Consolidated Financial Statements of the group are prepared  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  India  including  Indian  Accounting Standards  (Ind  AS)  under  the  historical  cost  convention on accrual basis, as per the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013  (&rsquo;the  Act&rsquo;),  except  for  certain  financial  assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting year. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the considerations given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sale an assets or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
<p>Financial instruments - measured at fair value; Assets held for  sale  -  measured  at  fair  value  less  cost  of  sale;  Plan assets under defined benefit plans - measured at fair value Liability for cash settled - measured at fair value In addition, the  carrying  values  of  recognized  assets  and  liabilities, designated  as  hedged  items  in  fair  value  hedges  that would otherwise be carried at cost, are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge relationships.</p>

  C) Significant accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions:
  <a class="anchor" href="#c-significant-accounting-estimates-judgments-and-assumptions">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments  and  assumptions  affect  the    application  of accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amounts  of  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statement  and  the reported  amount  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the reporting period. The accounting estimates are defined as &lsquo;monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.</p>
<p>This note provides an overview of the areas where there is  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  or  complexity.  Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the year end date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described as below. The Company based on its assumptions, judgments and estimates on parameters available, when the financial statements were prepared, the existing circumstances and assumptions  about  future  developments,  however,  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.</p>

<ul>
<li>-Impairment;</li>
<li>-Useful lifes of property, plant and equipment;</li>
<li>-Provision for litigations and contingencies;</li>

<p>The  group  presents  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  balance sheet based on current/non-current classification.</p>
<p>An asset is classified as current when it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>i) Expected  to  be  realized  or  intended  to  be  sold  or consumed in normal operating cycle;</li>
<li>ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading;</li>
<li>iii) Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or</li>
<li>iv) Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>A liability is classified current when:</p>
<ul>
<li>i) It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;</li>
<li>ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading;</li>
<li>iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or</li>
<li>iv) There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of  the  liability  for  at  least  twelve  months  after  the reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as Non-Current assets and liabilities  respectively.</p>
<p>The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. The group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.</p>

</h2>
<p>Property,  plant  and  equipment  held  for  use  in  the production, supply or administrative purposes are stated in the Consolidated Balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any.</p>
<p>Property,  plant  and  equipment  represent  a  significant proportion of the asset   base of the group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an  estimate  of  an  asset&rsquo;s  expected  useful  life  and  the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company&rsquo;s assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The  lives  are  based  on  historical  experience  with  similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.</p>
<p>The  cost  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  comprises its purchase  price  (including  the  costs  of  materials/ components)  net  of  any  trade  discounts  and  rebates, any  import  duties  and  other  taxes  (other  than  those subsequently  recoverable  from  the  tax  authorities),  any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs for qualifying  assets  including  exchange  differences  arising from foreign currency and such other incidental costs that may be associated with acquisition or creation of the asset ready for its intended use.</p>
<p>Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset&rsquo;s  carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only  when  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured  reliably.  The  carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance related to such assets which are in recurring nature and has no certainty of the useful life are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss during the year.</p>
<p>An  item  or  part  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Profit &amp; Loss as and when the asset is derecognized.</p>
<p>Property,  plant  and  equipment  which  are  not  ready  for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as  &lsquo;Capital  work-in-progress&rsquo;.  Capital  work-in-progress represents  expenditure  incurred  on  capital  assets  that are  under  construction/erection  or  are  pending  to  be commercialized and put to use. The same is carried at cost which is determined in the same manner as for any Property, Plant and Equipment.</p>
<p>Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and  equipment  outstanding  at  each  balance  sheet  date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets  and  the  cost  of  assets  not  ready  to  use  before such date are disclosed under &lsquo;Capital work-in-progress&rsquo;. Subsequent  expenditures  relating  to  property,  plant  and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic  benefits  associated  with  these  will  flow  to  the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs related to property, plant &amp; equipment are recognized in the Statement of Profit and</p>
<p>Loss  when  incurred.  The  cost  and  related  accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.</p>

<p>Fixed  Assets  purchased  for  specific  projects  will  be depreciated over the periods of the project or the useful life stated as above, whichever is shorter. No Depreciation has been provided for the land.</p>
<p>Depreciation on assets acquired/purchased, sold/discarded during the year is provided on a pro-rata basis from the date of each addition or till the date of sale/retirement.</p>
<p>The economic useful life of assets is assessed based on a  technical  evaluation,  taking  into  account  the  nature of  assets,  the  estimated  usage  of  assets,  the  operating conditions  of  the  assets,  past  history  of  replacement, anticipated  technological  changes,  maintenance  history, etc. The estimated useful life is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with effect of any change in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.</p>
<p>Where the cost of part of the asset is significant to the total cost of the assets and the useful life of that part is different from the useful of the remaining asset, useful life of that significant  part  is  determined  separately.  Depreciation of such significant part, if any, is based on the useful life of that part.</p>
<p>An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are expected  to  arise  from  the  continued  use  of  the  asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment, determined as the difference  between  the  sales  proceeds  and  the  carrying amount  of  the  asset,  is  recognized  in  the  Statement  of Profit or Loss.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="c-intangible-assets">
  c) Intangible Assets:
  <a class="anchor" href="#c-intangible-assets">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Intangible assets are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortisation  and  cumulative  impairment.  Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and  capitalised  as  a  part  of  the  cost  of  the  intangible assets. Intangible development costs are capitalised as and when technical and commercial feasibility of the asset is demonstrated and future economic benefits are probable.</p>
<p>Intangible  assets  are  stated  at  acquisition  cost,  net  of accumulated amortization. The Company  amortized intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using the Written  Down  method  as  per  Companies  Act,  2013.  The Management has estimated the useful lives of intangible assets are as  follows:</p>
<p>The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite  or  indefinite.  Intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  are amortized  over  the  useful  economic  life  and  assessed for  impairment  whenever  there  is  an  indication  that  the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.</p>
<p>All intangible assets are tested for impairment. Amortization expenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Thus, after initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and/or impairment losses.</p>
<p>The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to determine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.</p>
<p>For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  the  recoverable amount  (i.e.  the  higher  of  the  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an  individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are  largely  independent  of  those  from  other  assets.  In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss and is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the  assets  exceeds  the  estimated  recoverable  amount of the asset.</p>
<p>Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset  are  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.</p>

<p>The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates (&rsquo;the functional currency&rsquo;). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Indian rupee ( &rsquo; ), which is the  functional and presentation currency of the Company and the same is rounded off to the nearest Lakhs Rupees with two decimals.</p>
<p>For the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements all the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, together with goodwill and fair value adjustments assumed on acquisition thereof, are translated to Indian Rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period end and income and expense items are translated at the weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the period.</p>
<p>All foreign currency transactions are recorded by applying to the foreign currency amount at the exchange rate between the  functional  currency  and  the  foreign  currency  at  the date of the transaction on initial recognition.

<p>Ind AS 115 applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising  from  contracts  with  its  customers.  Ind  AS  115 establishes  a  five-step  model  to  account  for  revenue arising  from  contracts  with  customers  and  requires  that revenue  be  recognized  at  an  amount  that  reflects  the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. Ind AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgment, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their  customers.  It  also  specifies  the  accounting  for  the incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  the  costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.</p>

The Company identifies contracts with customers and its performance obligations under the contract, determines the transaction price and its allocation to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue only on  satisfactory  completion  of  performance  obligations. Revenue  is  measured  at  fair  value  of  the  consideration received or receivable.</p>
<p>Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is recognized at the &rsquo;transaction price&rsquo; when the goods are &rsquo;transferred&rsquo; to the customer. The &rsquo;transaction price&rsquo; is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, goods and service tax). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. The revenue from sale is recognized when significant risk and reward of ownership/control have been transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery, the amount of revenue can be  measured  reliable  and  recovery  of  the  consideration is probable.</p>

<p>The current tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the year based on applicable rate of taxes of the particular country to which the group entities belongs. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the statement of profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The current tax is calculated using  the  tax  rates  tax  laws  that  have  been  enacted  or substantially  enacted  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  year.</p>
<p>Provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after offsetting advance tax &amp; TDS paid for the relevant year.</p>
<p>Deferred  tax  is  recognised  on  temporary  differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Company&rsquo;s financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit and quantified using  the  tax  rates  and  laws  enacted  or  substantively enacted as on the Balance Sheet date.</p>
<p>Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  for  all  taxable temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Deferred  tax  assets  are recognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  to  the extent that is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.</p>
<p>The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets are to be recovered. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that  it  has  become  probable  that  future  taxable  profits will be available against which the deferred tax assets to be recovered.</p>
<p>The  measurement  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.</p>

<p>The  group  applies  the  expected  credit  loss  model  for recognizing impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortized cost, other contractual right to receive cash or other financial assets not designated at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for a financial instrument is equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increase significantly since initial recognition, the Company  measures  the  loss  allowance  for  that  financial instrument  at  an  amount  equal  12  months  expected credit losses.</p>
<p>The 12 months expected credit losses are portion of the lifetime expected credit losses and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls that will result if the default occurs within 12 months after the reporting date.</p>
<p>For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial assets that results from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18, the Company always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The Company has used a practical expedient  permitted  by  Ind  AS  109  and  determines  the expected credit loss allowance based on a provision matrix which takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward looking information.</p>

If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  and  continues  to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for the amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of the  transferred  financial  asset,  the  Company  continues to  recognize  the  financial  asset  and  also  recognizes  a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.</p>
<p>On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset&rsquo;s carrying amount and the sum of consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income, if any, is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the financial asset.</p>

Hence the  operating  results  and  financials  of  the  Company may  be  impacted  due  to  volatility  of  the  rupee  against foreign currencies.</p>

<p>The  group  has  a  risk  management  framework  aimed  at prudently  managing  the  risk  arising  from  the  volatility in  commodity  prices  and  freight  costs.  The  Company&rsquo;s commodity  risk  is  managed  centrally  through  wellestablished  control  processes  and  also  future  market position  in  accordance  with  the  risk  management  policy. Further the group invests its surplus funds in deposits with banks on short term tenors on fixed interest rate and the same is not exposed to any price risk. This risk is mitigated by investing the funds in various tenors depending on the liquidity needs of the group.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="b-management-of-credit-risk">
  B) Management of Credit Risk:
  <a class="anchor" href="#b-management-of-credit-risk">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligations by a counter party to the Group resulting in a financial loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities i.e. trade receivable, foreign exchange transactions  and  financial  instruments.  Credit  risk  from trade  receivables  is  managed  through  the  Company&rsquo;s policies,  procedures  and  controls  relating  to  customer credit  risk  management  by  establishing  credit  limits, credit  approvals  and  monitoring  creditworthiness  of  the customers to which the Group extends credit in the normal course  of  business.  Outstanding  customer  receivables are regularly monitored. The Group has no concentration of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed. The Company&rsquo;s historical experience of collecting receivables and level of default indicate that credit risk is low  and  generally  uniform  across  markets  consequently, trade  receivables  are  considered  to  be  a  single  class  of financial assets.</p>
<p>All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognized, where considered appropriate by  responsible  management.  The  Group  has  receivable at the year ended where in the debtor&rsquo;s parties are under</p>
<p>NCLT. The total amount receivable from such debtors is for &rsquo; 15.40 Lakhs. The management is hopeful to receive the same therefore the same has been considered good at the year ended.</p>

  C) Management of Liquidity Risk:
  <a class="anchor" href="#c-management-of-liquidity-risk">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to  meet  its  present  and  future  cash  obligations  without incurring unacceptable losses. The Group&rsquo;s objective is to maintain at all times, optimum levels of liquidity to meet obligations. The Group closely monitors its liquidity position and  has  a  cash  management  system.  The  Company maintains adequate sources of financing including debt and overdraft from banks and financial markets at optimized cost. The Group&rsquo;s current assets aggregate to &rsquo; 28,007.77 Lakhs  (PY  2023: &rsquo; 15,443.93  Lakhs)  including  cash  and cash equivalents and other bank balances of &rsquo; 10,572.31 Lakhs  (PY  2023: &rsquo; 625.29  Lakhs)  against  an  aggregate current  liability  of &rsquo; 8,103.68  Lakhs  (PY  2023: &rsquo; 7,893.23 Lakhs)  Non-Current  liabilities  due  between  one  year  to three  years  amounting  to &rsquo; NIL  (PY  2023:  98.57)  and Non-Current liabilities due after three years amounting to NIL (PY 2023: NIL) on the reporting date. Further, while the group&rsquo;s total equity stands at &rsquo; 29,314.98 Lakhs (PY 2023: &rsquo; 11,409.31), it has Non-Current borrowings of &rsquo; 6.34 Lakhs (PY 2023: &rsquo; 1,968.63). In such circumstances, liquidity risk or the risk that the group may not be able to settle or meet its obligation as they become due does not exist.</p>

</h2>
<p>We  conducted  our  audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs),  as  specified  under  Section  143(10)  of  the  Act. Our  responsibilities  under  those  Standards  are  further described in the &lsquo;Auditors&rsquo; responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements&rsquo; Section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the  &lsquo;Code  of  Ethics&rsquo;  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.</p>

  KEY AUDIT MATTERS
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-audit-matters-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  for  the  financial  year ended March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.</p>
<p>We have determined the matters described below the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Our audit procedures, amongst others, include the following:</p>
<p>Accuracy, Completeness and disclosure with reference to Ind  AS  16  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  including Capital Work  in  Progress.  The  carrying  value  of property, plant and equipment includes of &rsquo; 64.25 Lakhs capitalized/transferred  from  capital  work  in  progress during  the  year.  The  Company  has  capital  work  in progress  at  the  year  ended  as  on  March  31,  2024  of &rsquo; 537.83  Lakhs.  Cost  Recognition  of  Property,  Plant and  Equipment  as  specified  in  Ind  AS  16  is  based on  completion  of  asset  construction  activities  and management assessment and judgment that the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended. The asset capitalization  is  the  outcome  of  various  procurements, approvals from operations experts in the Company and judgments by the management and therefore, required significant  audit  attention.  Refer  Note  1:  Property, Plant  and  Equipment  in  Notes  to  the  Standalone Financial Statements.</p>

  MANAGEMENT&rsquo;S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  <a class="anchor" href="#managements-responsibilities-for-the-standalone-financial-statements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, state of affairs, profit &amp; loss including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards and accounting principles generally accepted in India including the accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act.</p>
<p>This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness of  the  accounting  records,  relevant  to  the  preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</p>
<p>In  preparing  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements,  the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing  the  Company&rsquo;s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but</p>
<p>to  do  so.  The  Board  of  Directors  is  also  responsible  for overseeing the Company&rsquo;s financial reporting process.</p>

  AUDITORS&rsquo; RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  <a class="anchor" href="#auditors-responsibilities-for-the-audit-of-the-standalone-financial-statements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors&rsquo; report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.</p>
<p>As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.</li>
<li>2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial  controls  system  in  place  and  the  operating effectiveness of such controls.</li>
<li>3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related  disclosures  made  by  Management  and Board of Directors.</li>
<li>4 Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  Management&rsquo;s and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of Standalone Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. If we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditors&rsquo; report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors&rsquo; report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.</li>
<li>5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the</li>
</ul>
<p>disclosures,  and  whether  the  Standalone  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.</p>
<p>We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.</p>
<p>We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.</p>
<p>From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements  for  the  financial  year  ended March  31,  2024  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditors&rsquo; report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure  about  the  matter  or  when,  in  extremely rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should not be  communicated  in  our  report  because  the adverse  consequences  of  doing  so  would  reasonably be  expected  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  benefits  of such communication.</p>

<p>Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (&rsquo;the Act&rsquo;).</p>

<p>The  Company&rsquo;s  management  and  Board  of  Directors is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  internal financial  controls  based  on  the  internal  control  with reference  to  Standalone  Financial  Statements  based  on the  criteria  established  by  the  Company  considering  the essential  components  of  internal  control  stated  in  the Guidance  Note.  These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company&rsquo;s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.</p>

  AUDITORS&rsquo; RESPONSIBILITY

</h2>
<p>Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  Standalone Financial  Statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  have conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  over  Standalone Financial Statements and the Standards on Auditing issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of  the  Companies  Act,  2013,  to  the  extent  applicable  to an  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to Standalone  Financial  Statements.  Those  Standards  and the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain reasonable  assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  Standalone  Financial Statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.</p>
<p>Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and  their  operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of  internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  Standalone  Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls  over  Standalone  Financial  Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors&rsquo; judgments, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.</p>
<p>We believe that the audit evidence, we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company&rsquo;s internal financial controls system over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to  standalone financial statements.</p>

  MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  <a class="anchor" href="#meaning-of-internal-financial-controls-with-reference-to-standalone-financial-statements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A  Company&rsquo;s  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to Standalone  Financial  Statements  is  a  process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company&rsquo;s internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Company;</li>
<li>2 Provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation of  Standalone  Financial  Statements  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and</li>
<li>3 Provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition, use,  or  disposition  of  the  Company&rsquo;s  assets  that could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Standalone Financial Statements.</li>

  INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  <a class="anchor" href="#inherent-limitations-of-internal-financial-controls-with-reference-to-standalone-financial-statements">#</a>

<p>Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or improper  management  override  of  controls,  material misstatements  due  to  fraud  may  occur  and  not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>

  2.1 Basis of Preparation &amp; Presentation of Financial Statements:
  <a class="anchor" href="#21-basis-of-preparation--presentation-of-financial-statements">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The Standalone Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India including Indian Accounting Standards (referred as Ind AS) as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act,  2013  (the  &lsquo;Act&rsquo;)  read  with  the  Companies  (Indian Accounting  Standards)  Rules  2015,  as  amended  and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 including presentation and disclosure requirements of Division II of Schedule III of the Act as amended from time-to-time.</p>
<p>Accordingly,  the  Company  has  prepared  these  Financial Statements which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31,  2024,  the  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  for  the  year ended March 31, 2024, the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended as on that date, and accounting policies and  other  explanatory  information  (together hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;Financial Statements&rsquo;).</p>

</h2>
<p>The  Standalone  Financial  Statements  of  the  Company are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Indian  Accounting Standards  (Ind  AS)  under  the  historical  cost  convention on  accrual  basis,  except  for  certain  financial  assets  and liabilities  that  are  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  end  of each reporting year. Historical cost is generally based on</p>
<p>the fair value of the considerations given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sale an assets or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="23-significant-accounting-estimates-judgments-and-assumptions">
  2.3 Significant accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions:
  <a class="anchor" href="#23-significant-accounting-estimates-judgments-and-assumptions">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and  assumptions  affect  the  application  of  accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates are defined as &lsquo;monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.</p>
<p>This note provides an overview of the areas where there is  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  or  complexity.  Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the year end date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described as below. The Company based on its assumptions, judgments and estimates on parameters available, when the financial statements were prepared, the existing circumstances and assumptions  about  future  developments,  however,  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.</p>

  a) Impairment of property, plant and equipment:
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-impairment-of-property-plant-and-equipment">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Determining whether property, plant and equipment is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating unit. The value in use calculation requires the management to estimate the future cash flows  expected  to  arise  from  the  cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. When the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise.  property,  plant  and  equipment  which  are  out dated or not in use are impaired and shown at the net releasable value and difference to the written down value and net releasable value is transferred to profit &amp; loss account for the year.</p>

  c) Provision for litigations and contingencies:
  <a class="anchor" href="#c-provision-for-litigations-and-contingencies">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The provision for litigations and contingencies are  determined  based  on  evaluation  made  by  the management  of  the  present  obligation  arising  from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result  in  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic benefits, which involves judgments around estimating the  ultimate  outcome  of  such  past  events  and measurement  of  the  obligation  amount.  Due  to  the judgments involved in such estimations the provisions are sensitive to the actual outcome in future periods.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="d-recognition-of-deferred-tax">
  d) Recognition of Deferred Tax:
  <a class="anchor" href="#d-recognition-of-deferred-tax">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities can  be  recognized  is  based  on  an  assessment  of the  profitability  of  the  Company&rsquo;s  future  taxable income against which the deferred tax provisions can be utilized.</p>
<ul>

<p>The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. An asset is classified as current when it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>i Expected  to  be  realized  or  intended  to  be  sold  or consumed in normal operating cycle;</li>
<li>ii Held primarily for the purpose of trading;</li>
<li>iii Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or</li>
<li>iv. Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>A liability is classified current when:</p>
<ul>
<li>i It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;</li>
<li>ii Held primarily for the purpose of trading;</li>
<li>iii It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or</li>
<li>iv There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of  the  liability  for  at  least  twelve  months  after  the reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities respectively.</p>
<p>The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.</p>
<p>Further the management of the Company provide the inputs related to the particular assets &amp; liability whether the same is recoverable &amp; payable within the operating cycle and to be considered as current assets &amp; liabilities or the same is recoverable or payable after the said operating cycle and to  be  considered  as  Non-Current.

  a) Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-property-plant-and-equipment-ppe-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Property,  plant  and  equipment  represent  a  significant proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an  estimate  of  an  asset&rsquo;s  expected  useful  life  and  the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company&rsquo;s assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The  lives  are  based  on  historical  experience  with  similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="recognition-and-measurement">
  Recognition and measurement:
  <a class="anchor" href="#recognition-and-measurement">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Property,  plant  and  equipment  held  for  use  in  the production, supply or administrative purposes are stated in the Balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any.</p>
<p>The  cost  of  Property,  plant  and  equipment  comprises its purchase  price  (including  the  costs  of  materials/ components)  net  of  any  trade  discounts  and  rebates, any  import  duties  and  other  taxes  (other  than  those subsequently  recoverable  from  the  tax  authorities),  any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs for qualifying  assets  including  exchange  differences  arising from foreign currency and such other incidental costs that may be associated with acquisition or creation of the asset ready for its intended use.</p>

<p>Fixed  Assets  purchased  for  specific  projects  will  be depreciated over the periods of the project or the useful life stated as above, whichever is shorter. No Depreciation has been provided for the land.</p>
<p>Depreciation on assets acquired/purchased, sold/discarded during the year is provided on a pro-rata basis from the date of each addition or till the date of sale/retirement.</p>
<p>The  economic  useful  life  of  assets  is  assessed  based on  a  technical  evaluation,  taking  into  account  the nature  of  assets,  the  estimated  usage  of  assets,  the operating  conditions  of  the  assets,  past  history  of replacement, anticipated technological changes, maintenance  history,  etc.  The  estimated  useful  life  is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with effect of  any  change  in  estimate  being  accounted  for  on  a prospective basis.</p>
<p>Where the cost of part of the asset is significant to the total cost of the assets and the useful life of that part is different from the useful of the remaining asset, useful life of that significant part is determined separately. Depreciation of such significant part, if any, is based on the useful life of that part.</p>
<p>An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are expected  to  arise  from  the  continued  use  of  the  asset.

<h2 class="heading" id="c-intangible-assets-1">
  c) Intangible Assets:
  <a class="anchor" href="#c-intangible-assets-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Intangible assets are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortization  and    cumulative  impairment.  Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and  capitalized  as  a  part  of  the  cost  of  the  intangible assets. Intangible development costs are capitalized as and when technical and commercial feasibility of the asset is demonstrated and future economic benefits are probable.</p>
<p>Intangible  assets  are  stated  at  acquisition  cost,  net  of accumulated amortization. The Company  amortized intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using the Written  Down  method  as  per  Companies  Act,  2013.  The Management has estimated the useful lives of intangible assets are as  follows:</p>
<p>The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite  or  indefinite.  Intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  are amortized  over  the  useful  economic  life  and  assessed for  impairment  whenever  there  is  an  indication  that  the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.</p>
<p>Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset  are  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="d-impairment">
  d) Impairment:
  <a class="anchor" href="#d-impairment">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss and is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.</p>

Ind  AS  115 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires that revenue be recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.</p>
<p>Ind AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgment, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their  customers.  It  also  specifies  the  accounting  for  the incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  the  costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.</p>

The Company  identifies  contracts  with  customers  and  its performance  obligations  under  the  contract,  determines the transaction price and its allocation to the performance obligations  in  the  contract  and  recognizes  revenue  only on  satisfactory  completion  of  performance  obligations. Revenue  is  measured  at  fair  value  of  the  consideration received or receivable.</p>
<p>Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is recognized at the &rsquo;transaction price&rsquo; when the goods are &rsquo;transferred&rsquo; to the customer. The &rsquo;transaction price&rsquo; is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, goods and service tax). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. The revenue from sale is recognized when significant risk and reward of ownership/control have been transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery, the amount of revenue can be  measured  reliable  and  recovery  of  the  consideration is probable.</p>

<p>Raw materials, packaging materials and stores and spare parts are valued at after reviewing the cost and net realizable value considering the various other related parameters and uniformity of the valuation. Cost includes purchase price, freight inwards and other expenditure incurred in bringing such  inventories  to  their  present  location  and  condition. In  determining  the  cost,  weighted  average  cost  method is used.</p>
<p>Work in progress, manufactured finished goods and traded goods are valued at cost of production till the date work completed.  Cost  of  work  in  progress  and  manufactured finished goods is determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct material, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing these inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of traded goods is determined on a weighted average cost basis.</p>
<p>Provision of obsolescence on inventories is considered on the  basis  of  management&rsquo;s  estimate  based  on  demand and market of the inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

<p>The Company applies the expected credit loss model for recognizing impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortized cost, other contractual right to receive cash or other financial assets not designated at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for a financial instrument is equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increase significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal 12 months expected credit losses. 12 months expected credit losses are portion of the lifetime expected credit losses and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls that will result if the default occurs within 12 months after the reporting date.</p>
<p>For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial assets that results from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18, the Company always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.

If  the  Company  neither  transfers  nor  retains substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes  its  retained  interest  in  the  asset  and  an associated  liability  for  the  amounts  it  may  have  to  pay. If the  Company  retains  substantially  all  the  risks  and rewards  of  ownership  of  the  transferred  financial  asset, the  Company  continues  to  recognize  the  financial  asset and  also  recognizes  a  collateralized  borrowing  for  the proceeds received.</p>
<p>On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset&rsquo;s carrying amount and the sum of consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income, if any, is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the financial asset.</p>

<p>Financial  liabilities  are  classified,  at  initial  recognition,  as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="b-other-financial-liabilities-1">

<p>Other  financial  liabilities  (including  loans  and  borrowings, bank  overdrafts  and  trade  and  other  payables)  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</p>
<p>The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future  cash  payments  (including  all  fees  and amounts  paid  or  received  that  form  an  integral  part  of the  effective  interest  rate,  transaction  costs  and  other premiums  or  discounts)  through  the  expected  life  of  the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortized cost on initial recognition.</p>
<p>Interest expense (based on the effective interest method), foreign exchange gains and losses, and any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  For  trade  and  other  payables  maturing  within  one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate  fair  value  due  to  the  short  maturity  of these instruments.</p>

<p>Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial  liabilities  held  for  trading  and  financial  liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.</p>
<p>Financial  liabilities  (that  are  not  held  for  trading  or  not designated at fair value through profit or loss) are measured at  amortized  cost  at  the  end  of  subsequent  accounting year. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortized cost are determined based in the effective interest method.</p>
<p>Effective  interest  method  is  a  method  of  calculating amortized  cost  of  a  financial  liability  and  of  allocating interest  expense  over  the  relevant  period.  The  effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the  expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period,  to  the  net  carrying  amount  on  initial  recognition. Interest expenses of these financial liabilities are included in finance cost. Expenditure incurred for management of the finance of the Company are forming part of the finance cost.</p>

<p>Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  offset  and presented on net basis in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognized amounts and it is intended to either settle them on net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="fair-value-of-financial-instruments-1">
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
  <a class="anchor" href="#fair-value-of-financial-instruments-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and available quoted market prices, where applicable. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. Financial instruments by  category  are  separately  disclosed  indicating  carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.</p>

<p>The fair value of financial Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. For financial Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value through profit or loss, the foreign exchange component forms part of the fair value gains or losses and is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss except in case of the amount outstanding to creditors towards the fixed  assets  where  the    amount  is  outstanding  payable, in  that  case  every  year  the  difference  in  the  exchange fluctuation  has  been  adjusted  towards  the  cost  of  the fixed assets so purchased and has to uniformly followed the practice.</p>

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.</p>

  <a class="anchor" href="#b-management-of-credit-risk-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligations by a counter party to the Company resulting in a financial loss to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its</p>
<p>operating activities i.e. trade receivable, foreign exchange transactions  and  other  financial  instruments.  Credit  risk from trade receivables is managed through the Company&rsquo;s policies,  procedures  and  controls  relating  to  customer credit risk management by establishing credit limits, credit approvals and monitoring creditworthiness of the customers to which the Company extends credit in the normal course of business. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company has no concentration of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed. The Company&rsquo;s historical  experience  of  collecting  receivables  and  level of  default  indicate  that  credit  risk  is  low  and  generally uniform across markets consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer  balances  are  evaluated  taking  into  account the  age  of  the  dues,  specific  credit  circumstances,  the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and</p>
<p>impairment  is  recognized,  where  considered  appropriate by responsible management. The Company has receivable at the year ended where in the debtor&rsquo;s parties are under NCLT. The total amount receivable from such debtors is for &rsquo; 15.40 Lakhs. The management is hopeful to receive the same therefore the same has been considered good at the year ended.</p>
