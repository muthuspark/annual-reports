<p>Crisil Limited demonstrated resilience in 2024, achieving moderate consolidated revenue growth (3.6%) amidst a complex global environment. Profitability improved, with Profit Before Tax (PBT) rising to INR 926.47 crore and Profit After Tax (PAT) reaching INR 684.07 crore, although 2023 results included a significant one-off gain. Growth was primarily driven by the Ratings segment, capitalizing on healthy domestic bond issuances, while the Research, Analytics, and Solutions segment faced headwinds from curtailed discretionary spending by global financial clients. Strategic initiatives included a major brand transformation to position Crisil as a global analytics organization, continued investment in technology (notably GenAI), talent development, and sustainability integration (including obtaining an ESG Ratings Provider license). The company maintained a strong financial position, supported by an asset-light model and robust cash flows, allowing for a recommended increase in total dividend payout. Key risks revolve around macroeconomic uncertainty, cybersecurity, competitive intensity, talent retention, and the potential impact of GenAI disruption. The outlook remains cautiously optimistic, contingent on global economic stability and client spending patterns.</p>

<p>The Independent Auditor, Walker Chandiok &amp; Co LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on both the standalone and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The statements are reported to give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013. The opinion on consolidated statements is based partly on the reports of other auditors for certain subsidiaries and branches. No qualifications or adverse remarks were noted in the main audit report or the Secretarial Audit Report.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="key-accounting-policies">
  Key Accounting Policies
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-accounting-policies">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual basis, conforming to Ind AS notified under the Companies Act, 2013. Key accounting policies consistently applied include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):</strong> Complexities noted, particularly for initial rating fees (portion deferred for surveillance), subscription services (time proportion), and project-based services like infrastructure consulting (percentage completion method based on costs incurred). Revenue recognition was identified as a Key Audit Matter due to significant judgments involved.</li>
<li><strong>Leases (Ind AS 116):</strong> Right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities are recognized, with specific criteria for lease term determination and exclusions for short-term/low-value leases.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments (Ind AS 109):</strong> Classification based on business models (amortised cost, FVTOCI, FVTPL). Impairment is assessed using the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, with a simplified approach for trade receivables. Derivatives are used for hedging foreign exchange risk, primarily using cash flow hedges.</li>
<li><strong>Business Combinations (Ind AS 103):</strong> Accounted for using the acquisition method; goodwill measured as consideration less net identifiable assets acquired at fair value.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment:</strong> Goodwill tested annually; other non-financial assets tested upon indication; financial assets assessed via ECL model.</li>
<li><strong>Share-Based Payments (Ind AS 102):</strong> Fair value expensed over the vesting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>No significant changes in accounting policies were reported for the year ended December 31, 2024, beyond consistent application of existing Ind AS.</p>

  Analysis of Accounting Quality
  <a class="anchor" href="#analysis-of-accounting-quality">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Accounting quality appears reasonable, supported by unqualified audit opinions and adherence to Ind AS. The consistent application of policies enhances reliability. However, the identification of Revenue Recognition as a Key Audit Matter underscores the significant judgments and estimates involved, particularly concerning performance obligation satisfaction and cost estimation for percentage-of-completion contracts. This area requires careful management oversight and represents a potential source of estimation uncertainty. Disclosures regarding critical estimates (impairment, leases, defined benefits, taxes) seem adequate.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="regulatory-risk-assessment">
  Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Crisil operates in highly regulated sectors (credit ratings, financial research, ESG ratings) across multiple jurisdictions (India, US, UK, Europe, APAC), exposing it to significant regulatory risk. Key areas include compliance with SEBI regulations (CRA, Research Analyst, ESG Ratings Provider, LODR), international financial regulations, data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA etc.), and cybersecurity mandates. The establishment of robust compliance frameworks, dedicated compliance functions, and regular audits (Statutory, Secretarial, Internal) act as mitigants. Cybersecurity and data privacy are highlighted as key operational and regulatory risks requiring continuous investment and vigilance. Minor tax disputes indicate ongoing engagement with fiscal authorities. Overall regulatory risk is assessed as moderate but inherent to the business model, requiring proactive management.</p>
