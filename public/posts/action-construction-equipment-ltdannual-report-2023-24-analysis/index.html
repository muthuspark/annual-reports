<p>The auditor&rsquo;s report includes an &ldquo;Other Matter&rdquo; paragraph indicating reliance on reports of other independent auditors for one subsidiary and one employee welfare trust. Additionally, the financial statements of two subsidiaries, whose financial information is deemed not material to the Group, were unaudited and based on management-certified information.</p>
<p>No qualifications were made on the financial statements themselves. However, under &ldquo;Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements&rdquo; (Rule 11(g) of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014), the auditor noted for both standalone and consolidated reports that while the company uses accounting software, the feature of recording an audit trail (edit log) facility has not been enabled.

<p>The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets, liabilities, and plan assets measured at fair value, in accordance with Ind AS. Key accounting policies consistently applied include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue Recognition: Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control to customers. Revenue from services is recognized as rendered.</li>
<li>Inventories: Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value.</li>
<li>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE): Measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.</li>
<li>Intangible Assets: Recorded at cost less accumulated amortization (straight-line) and impairment.</li>
<li>Financial Instruments: Classified and measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) based on business model and cash flow characteristics. Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied for impairment.</li>
<li>Leases: Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for leases, with exemptions for short-term and low-value leases.</li>
<li>Impairment: Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment indicators at each reporting date. Financial assets are assessed for ECL.</li>
<li>Employee Benefits: Include short-term benefits, defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans (actuarially valued), and share-based payments (fair valued at grant date).</li>
<li>Income Tax: Current tax is based on taxable income; deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences.</li>
