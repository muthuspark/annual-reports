  <meta property="og:description" content="Earnings Call Transcript Analysis Report # MedPlus Health Services Limited - Q3 FY25 Earnings Call Analysis # Financial Performance # Key Financial Metrics (Q3 FY25): Consolidated Revenue: INR 15,614 million (Growth of 8.3% Y-o-Y, Degrowth of 0.9% Q-o-Q). Consolidated Operating EBITDA: INR 799 million (Margin: 5.1%). Pharmacy Operations Revenue (constituting ~99% of total): GMV Basis: Grew by 12.3% Y-o-Y. Net Basis: Grew by 7.9% Y-o-Y. Pharmacy Operating EBITDA: INR 780 million (Margin: 5.1%). Stores &gt;12 Months Old: Revenue: INR 14,388 million (94% of pharmacy revenue). Store Level EBITDA Margin: 11%. Store Level Operating ROCE: 61.7%. Operating EBITDA (after allocated non-store related cost): INR 815 million (Margin: 5.6%). Diagnostics Revenue: INR 274.7 million (Growth from INR 196 million in Q3 FY24). Diagnostics Operating EBITDA: INR 22.1 million (Margin: 8.1%) (Compared to a loss of INR 34.1 million in Q3 FY24). Central level operating EBITDA for Diagnostics was INR 49 million. Private Label Sales (Q3 FY25): 19.6% of total revenue. Private Label Pharma Share (of total GMV): 17.7% (up from 7.9% in Q1 FY24). Net Working Capital (Q3): 61 days. Warehouse Inventory: 36 days. First-tier Store Inventory: 88 days. Stores &gt;12 months Inventory: 40 days. Comparison with Previous Periods: Consolidated revenue showed moderate Y-o-Y growth but a slight Q-o-Q dip. Pharmacy GMV growth was stronger than net revenue growth, likely due to increasing private label share (sold at lower prices). Diagnostics segment showed significant improvement, turning profitable Y-o-Y. Private label contribution to revenue and GMV has substantially increased compared to Q1 FY24. Revised Guidance or Forecasts: Net store additions for FY25 expected to be 300 (down from previous, implicit higher targets given earlier quarter run-rates). Net store additions for FY26 guided at “at least 600 stores.” Private label volume (MRP basis) expected to grow by ~1% per quarter, translating to an additional margin of ~15-20 bps per quarter. Areas of Growth or Decline: Growth: Private label sales (significant), Diagnostics business (revenue and profitability), overall pharmacy GMV (Y-o-Y). Decline/Slowdown: Net store additions were lower this quarter (60 net additions vs 108 in Q2). Consolidated revenue saw a slight Q-o-Q degrowth. SSSG seems to be in the low single digits (4-5% guided for future). Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategic Announcements: Strong focus on balancing growth with profitability and enhancing operational efficiency. Strategic strengthening of back-end operations and infrastructure for long-term scalability. Launch of MedPlus brand private label products continues to be a core strategy. New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed: Private Label Expansion: Currently over 1,200 SKUs. Aim to increase the number of products in private label, targeting up to 75-77% of applicable medicine range (currently at ~68%). Warehouse Expansion: Added 4 additional warehouses recently. Plan for a total of ~10 smaller warehouses (30,000-50,000 sq ft). Significant Operational Changes: Restructuring supply chain by dividing states into main and sub-areas managed by local warehouses to improve reach and efficiency. Focus on new store breakeven: Approximately 55% of stores opened between January 2024 and June 2024 achieved breakeven within 6 months of operations. Ongoing or Completed Projects: Backend strengthening and warehouse setup is ongoing, expected to be completed in Q4 FY25. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Insights about Industry Trends: Implied acceptance and potential growth of generic/private label pharmaceuticals. Government push for generic products seen as a potential tailwind. Competitive Positioning Statements: MedPlus positions its private label as a high-quality, significantly discounted alternative to branded medicines. Focus on store-level profitability (10-11% EBITDA for mature stores) rather than solely on SSSG, especially in markets with high store density. Market Challenges or Opportunities Mentioned: Challenge: Cannibalization in mature markets due to new store openings. Challenge: Quick commerce competition is being monitored. Opportunity: Increasing private label penetration. Opportunity: Expanding store network into new areas and deepening presence in existing ones with better supply chain support. Comments about Market Share or Positioning: Aim to continue gaining market share through store expansion. Private label penetration varies by geography. Risk Factors &amp; Challenges # Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management: Slower Store Additions: Current year’s store addition pace (target 300 net) is lower than initially implied, attributed to focus on private label rollout and backend strengthening. Muted GMV Growth (this quarter): Attributed partly to seasonality and the impact of private label (lower price point). Supply Chain Strain: Past rapid growth had strained the supply chain, impacting sales. This is being addressed with new warehouses. Cost Pressures: Wage increases and new warehouse rents impacting EBITDA. Supply Chain or Operational Constraints: Addressed above (strain, ongoing strengthening). Market Uncertainties: Impact of quick commerce is being monitored. Forward-Looking Statements # Outlook and Future Projections: Store Expansion: Expect 300 net store additions in FY25; “at least 600 stores” in FY26. Download Transcript">
