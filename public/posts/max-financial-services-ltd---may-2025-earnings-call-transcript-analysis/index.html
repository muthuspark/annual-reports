  <meta property="og:description" content="Earnings Call Transcript Analysis Report # Financial Performance # Key Financial Metrics (FY&#39;25) # Max Financial Services Limited (MFSL) Consolidated: Revenue (excluding investment income): Rs. 32,620 crore (12% growth YoY). Consolidated PAT: Rs. 403 crore. Axis Max Life Insurance: Individual adjusted first-year premium growth: 20% (vs. private sector 15%, industry 10%). Individual adjusted first-year premium 2-year CAGR: 18% (vs. private sector 12%, industry 8%). Renewal Premiums: Rs. 21,049 crore (14% growth). Gross Premiums: Rs. 33,223 crore (13% growth). Value of New Business (VNB): Rs. 2,107 crore (7% growth YoY). New Business Margin (NBM): 24% (Q4 NBM: 28.1%). Embedded Value (EV) as of March 31, 2025: Rs. 25,192 crore. Annualized Total Return on EV: 29%. Annualized Operating RoEV: 19.1% (includes Rs. 5 crore positive operating variance). Policyholder OPEX to GWP: 13.6% (Policyholder OPEX growth: 11% for FY&#39;25). Total Cost to GWP: 23.1%. Profit Before Tax (PBT) for 12 months FY&#39;25: Rs. 448 crore (20% growth). Solvency: 201% (up from 172% last March), supported by Rs. 500 crore subordinate debt raised. Assets Under Management (AUM): ~Rs. 1.75 lakh crore (16% growth). Rider APE growth: 300%. Comparison with Previous Periods # Individual adjusted first-year premium growth (20%) significantly outperformed the private sector (15%) and overall industry (10%) in FY&#39;25. NBM for FY&#39;25 was 24%, down 250 bps YoY, primarily due to a lower proportion of non-PAR and higher proposition of ULIPs in our product mix. Q4 NBM was 28.1%, marginally lower than last year’s margin of 28.6% despite having high ULIPs. Persistency: 13th-month regular pay premium persistency up ~100 bps to 87.6%; 25th-month persistency up 380 bps to ~74%. Revised Guidance or Forecasts # FY&#39;26 Growth: Aiming for at least 300-400 basis points upside versus private industry growth (estimated 13%-14%). FY&#39;26 Margins: Targeting NBM in the range of 24%-25%. Areas of Growth or Decline # Growth: Individual adjusted first-year premium, renewal premiums, gross premiums, VNB, PBT, AUM, Prop Channels (27% two-year growth), Protection business (35% in FY&#39;25), Individual New Business Sum Assured (31%), Rider APE (300%). Strong growth in April FY&#39;26 (close 24% as against private growth of around 2%). Decline: Overall NBM declined YoY due to product mix changes (higher ULIP). Case size for ULIP and Annuity declined in FY&#39;25 (Annuity due to shift to regular premium, ULIP due to customer segment and e-commerce ticket sizes). Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategic Announcements # Mission ‘Uday’ (FY&#39;26 Aspirations): On track to achieve targets related to online acquisition leadership, Prop Channel growth, Protection and Annuity leadership, and adding distribution partners. Rebranding to Axis Max Life Insurance: Positive impact observed across all vectors of awareness and consideration. Reverse Merger: Strong desire to proceed, awaiting regulatory clarity from the expected amendment to the Insurance Act, potentially in the monsoon session (August-September). New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed # Product Innovation in FY&#39;25: 80 product interventions (largely due to surrender guideline changes). STAR ULIP (Q4): Combines life coverage with market-linked returns, high sum assured multiples, flexible add-ons. Smart-Term Plan Plus (Q4): Features auto-rebalancing life cover, maternity benefits, lifeline plus option, 7 flexible variants. SEWA 2.0 (Q3): Flagship health product. Upcoming Product Innovation in FY&#39;26: Smart Buy (Recently Launched): Non-PAR Savings Proposition with multiple premium payment terms, policy term combinations, early wealth/long-term income variants, flexible benefits. Market Expansion: Added 44 new partners across Retail and Group channels in FY&#39;25. Focus on deeper penetration into Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Significant Operational Changes # Digitization for Operational Efficiency: mSpace: Super app for frontline staff to streamline sales, access policy info, customer data, performance analytics. 90% adoption for supervisor roles, 100% for direct sales force in agency. WhatsApp Scheduled Callback: Led to a 100 bps increase in NPS. Core Systems Upgrade: Facilitating same-day claim settlements. mPulse Medical Vital Face Scan: Tool for health assessment for non-invasive underwriting, especially for NRI customers. AI for Underwriting: In-journey financial underwriting decision-making using CIBIL, PAYU, bank statements. Risk Analytics Engine (Shield, MediCheck, GoVern): Identified and mitigated potential claim risk exceeding Rs. 1,500 crores in FY&#39;25. ELY People Engagement platform 14.04 (Gen AI powered): Proactive employee engagement, sentiment assessment, attrition prediction, personalized HR support. Improved Grievance Handling: GIR reduced to 38 in FY&#39;25 from 44 in FY&#39;24. Ongoing or Completed Projects # Rebranding from Max Life to Axis Max Life Insurance (completed, positive initial results). Integration of new partners. Rollout of mSpace across all channels by end of the year. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Insights about Industry Trends # FY&#39;25 marked by “substantial product regulatory changes and market volatility.” Industry growth slowed in H2 FY&#39;25. Private industry grew 21% in the first half and only about 8% or 9% in the second-half. Evolution in product sales: Increased focus on Protection, Annuities, and Riders. Banks focusing on deposit building, impacting life insurance sales through bancassurance. Competitive Positioning Statements # Regained rank #4 for full year FY&#39;25, achieved rank #3 for H2 FY&#39;25 and Q4 FY&#39;25. Fastest growth among the top 10 private insurers over the past 2 years. Prop Channels (2-year growth 27%) and e-commerce maintained leadership in Protection and Savings. Rank #3 in Protection business and Individual New Business Sum Assured. Rank #2 in customer satisfaction (Hansa Research syndicated NPS study) for the third consecutive year. Rank #3 in brand search queries. Industry leader in 25th-month persistency (top 2 across all cohorts, 9-month disclosure). Market Challenges or Opportunities Mentioned # Challenges: Regulatory changes, market volatility, headwinds of open architecture in Bancassurance. Opportunities: Under-penetration of Protection. Deeper penetration into Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Evolving customer needs for value and unmet needs satisfaction. Comments about Market Share or Positioning # Counter share at Axis Bank stable at ~66%; Yes Bank counter share ~54%. Axis Max Life’s market share on sum assured basis is “substantially high,” ranking as #3 player. Risk Factors &amp; Challenges # Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management # Impact of new surrender regulations on product design and margins (though largely mitigated for Q4). Higher proportion of ULIPs (44% vs 36% last year) impacting overall NBM. Slower growth in Bancassurance channel, including Axis Bank, though plans are in place to improve this. Base effect for high-growth channels like e-commerce. Regulatory Issues Mentioned # New surrender regulations implemented, requiring significant product interventions. Ongoing “regulatory noise” around bancassurance. Awaiting Insurance Act amendment for clarity on reverse merger (Section 35 relief). Statements about Market Uncertainties # Geopolitical developments continue to influence market dynamics, rising uncertainty around global conflicts and trade policies may impact growth across the sector. Market volatility affecting ULIP sales and product mix. Forward-Looking Statements # Outlook and Future Projections # Confident in remaining ahead of the industry and driving sustained value. Expectation to rebalance product mix in FY&#39;26, reducing ULIP proportion and increasing traditional, especially non-PAR. Continued strong growth in the Protection segment. Download Transcript">
