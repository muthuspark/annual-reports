</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable to Increasing</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The wealth management sector is closely tied to economic performance and market sentiment. While India&rsquo;s growth provides opportunities, global instability and potential economic slowdowns pose risks. Competition from banks, non-banks, and fintech platforms necessitates continuous adaptation. Failure to capture the growing HNI segment or adapt to changing client preferences could impact market share and AUM growth. Geographic expansion introduces execution risks.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Focus on specific HNI segment, objective-driven investment strategy, holistic value-added services, strong RM network, digital platform development, leveraging India&rsquo;s growth trajectory.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Strong AUM growth, high net inflows, increasing client families, and low client attrition suggest effective strategy execution. Positive economic outlook for India provides tailwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Slower AUM growth, reduced net inflows, lower fee income, market share erosion.</li>

<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Reliance on technology creates significant cybersecurity and data privacy risks. Business continuity is critical. Attracting and retaining skilled Relationship Managers (RMs) and Account Managers (AMs) is vital for client relationships and growth. Process failures or internal fraud could lead to financial loss and reputational damage.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Investment in technology infrastructure, cybersecurity measures, Information Security Management System, robust internal controls, business continuity planning, employee training, RM/AM hiring and development strategy, entrepreneurial culture with incentives, Vigil Mechanism/Whistleblower Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Low RM attrition, &lsquo;Great Place to Work&rsquo; certification, no reported fraud/significant control deficiencies, successful implementation of digital platforms.</li>

Liquidity risk seems well-managed given cash position and nature of business. Credit risk is low. Currency risk exists due to the Dubai representative office but appears minimal. Investment risk associated with Non-PP SPs and other investments.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Diversified product mix, objective-driven portfolio construction, focus on long-term client relationships, monitoring of receivables, hedging activities, regular monitoring of liquidity and funding by management. Financial instruments risk management framework overseen by Board/Audit Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Low client attrition suggests stable AUM base. Positive profitability and ROE. Debt levels are low. No defaults reported. Sensitivity analyses performed for interest rate, price, and currency risk.</li>
