  Financial Performance Analysis (FY 2023-24)
  <a class="anchor" href="#financial-performance-analysis-fy-2023-24">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Gufic Biosciences Limited reported standalone total revenue from operations of ₹80,667.57 lakhs for the financial year 2023-24, an increase from ₹69,062.08 lakhs in the previous financial year. Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA) stood at ₹14,804.86 lakhs, compared to ₹13,722.52 lakhs in FY 2022-23. The EBITDA margin for FY 2023-24 was 18.4%, a slight decrease from 19.8% in the previous year. Net Profit for FY 2023-24 was ₹8,613.55 lakhs, up from ₹7,970.48 lakhs. The domestic market constituted 89.07% of turnover, with exports at 10.93%; the company aims to expand export revenue. Consolidated financials mirror standalone figures as the key subsidiary, Gufic UK Limited, had no operational activity during the year. A final dividend of ₹0.10 per equity share (10%) has been recommended, with a total payout of ₹1,00,27,750.60.</p>
<p>Key financial ratios indicate an increase in the Debtors Turnover Ratio to 3.01 times (PY 2.40 times), attributed to longer credit periods for the new &lsquo;Sparsh&rsquo; division. The Interest Coverage Ratio declined to 9.64 times (PY 14.82 times) due to increased working capital loans associated with the Sparsh division. The Debt-Equity Ratio improved to 0.60 times (PY 0.90 times) following an equity share allotment and debt repayment. Return on Net Worth decreased to 16.17% (PY 22.92%) primarily due to the increased equity base from the share allotment and significant capital expenditure on the Indore plant, which is yet to contribute to revenue.</p>
<p>During FY24, the company raised ₹99.99 crores through a preferential allotment of 33,33,000 equity shares at ₹300 per share to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited (Non-Promoter). These funds were fully utilized for the repayment of debts. Standalone R&amp;D expenditure for FY24 was ₹2,316.52 lakhs (Capital: ₹915.23 lakhs, Revenue: ₹1,401.29 lakhs), a decrease from ₹3,930.22 lakhs in FY23 (Capital: ₹2,859.20 lakhs, Revenue: ₹1,071.02 lakhs). Foreign exchange earnings were ₹9,105.15 lakhs (PY ₹8,603.22 lakhs) and outgo was ₹20,483.07 lakhs (PY ₹27,156.19 lakhs).</p>

<p>Gufic Biosciences Limited demonstrated revenue growth in FY 2023-24. Standalone Total Revenue from Operations increased to ₹80,667.57 lakhs from ₹69,062.08 lakhs in FY 2022-23, a growth of approximately 16.80%. Consolidated revenue mirrored this performance due to the inactive status of its UK subsidiary, Gufic UK Limited, during the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Profit before Interest, Tax, Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA) on a standalone basis rose to ₹14,804.86 lakhs in FY 2023-24 from ₹13,722.52 lakhs in the prior year, an increase of 7.89%. The EBITDA margin, however, saw a contraction, declining to 18.35% in FY 2023-24 from 19.87% in FY 2022-23.</p>
<p>Net Profit (Profit for the year) on a standalone basis increased to ₹8,613.55 lakhs in FY 2023-24 from ₹7,970.48 lakhs in FY 2022-23, marking an 8.07% growth. The Net Profit Margin for FY 2023-24 stood at 10.68%, compared to 11.54% in FY 2022-23.</p>
<p>The financial consistency between standalone and consolidated figures is attributed to Gufic UK Limited having no operational activities in FY 2023-24, despite an investment made by the parent company on September 13, 2023.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debtors Turnover Ratio:</strong> Decreased from 3.87 times (implied from prior year data if FY23 was 3.01) to 3.01 times in FY24. This is attributed to increased debtors following the launch of the &lsquo;Sparsh&rsquo; division, which offers longer credit periods.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover Ratio:</strong> Decreased to 4.01 times in FY24 from 4.56 times (implied).</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio:</strong> Declined to 9.64 times in FY24 from 17.78 times (implied). This is linked to increased working capital loans due to higher debtors from the Sparsh division and a general increase in finance costs from ₹774.46 lakhs in FY23 to ₹1,154.19 lakhs in FY24 (standalone).</li>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Stood at 1.61 times in FY24, compared to 1.63 times (implied).</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio:</strong> Improved to 0.60 times in FY24 from 0.91 times (implied). This improvement is a result of an increase in equity share capital and share premium from the preferential allotment of shares.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Net Worth:</strong> Decreased to 16.17% in FY24 from 22.92% in FY23. This is attributed to the increased equity base and significant capital investment in the Indore plant, which is yet to commence production.</li>

</h3>
<p>The company&rsquo;s strategy revolves around four primary pillars:</p>
<ul>

Key brands like Dalbavancin (first in India for OPAT), Cavim (Ceftazidime + Avibactam), Immunocin-Alpha (sepsis therapy, DCGI approval pending), and novel pain management solutions. Market leadership with Guficap, Micafung (No.1 in Micafungin), Polyfic (No.1 in Polymyxin-B).</li>
<li><strong>Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART):</strong> Investing in recombinant hormone alternatives, advancements in endometriosis treatment (Thymosin Alpha 1 trial completed), and innovative products like Guficin Alpha (for Recurrent Implantation Failure) and Supergraf (ultra-purified HMG).</li>
<li><strong>Toxins:</strong> Democratizing access to botulinum toxin for cosmetic and therapeutic neurological applications through clinical trials and training. Stunnox (aesthetic) and Zarbot (neurology) are key products, with Zarbot gaining acceptance among neurologists.</li>
<li><strong>Science-Based Nutraceuticals:</strong> Continued development of Boswellia serrata-based nutraceuticals. Introduction of Polmacoxib (orthopedic specialty) and Gufican/Gufibis (topical cannabis 3% for pain management).</li>

  Outlook
  <a class="anchor" href="#outlook">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Gufic anticipates continued growth driven by its diversified product portfolio, particularly complex injectables. The Indore facility&rsquo;s operationalization is a key near-term catalyst. The company aims to launch approximately 25 products in FY25, with over 70 new products in development. Initiatives like &ldquo;Sankalp&rdquo; (patient assistance program) and innovative delivery systems (Merofic Dual Chamber Bag) are expected to enhance market penetration and patient engagement.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="risk-factors">
  Risk Factors
  <a class="anchor" href="#risk-factors">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The company identifies business risks (concentration, competition, price, international operations, human capital), financial risks (credit, treasury/forex, liquidity), and external risks (legal, cybersecurity, market, IP). Mitigation strategies include diversification, quality focus, cost control, hedging, robust credit approval processes, and compliance monitoring.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
  <a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Gufic Biosciences Limited reported a year of revenue growth and increased net profit in FY 2023-24, albeit with some pressure on operating margins. Strategic investments in capacity expansion (Indore plant), R&amp;D for complex injectables, and market development across its four core pillars position the company for future growth, particularly in international markets. The successful preferential allotment has strengthened the equity base and supported debt repayment. Challenges include managing credit periods in new divisions and ensuring the new capacity translates into improved profitability metrics once fully operational. The focus on exports and innovative product launches will be critical for sustained value creation.</p>
