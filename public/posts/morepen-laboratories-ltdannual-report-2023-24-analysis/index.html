</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debtors Turnover (Consolidated):</strong> 81.93 days (FY24) vs. 73.19 days (FY23). An increase indicates a longer period to collect receivables.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover Ratio (Consolidated):</strong> 3.35 times (FY24) vs. 3.94 times (FY23). This implies inventory was held for approximately 109 days (365/3.35) in FY24, compared to 93 days (365/3.94) in FY23, suggesting slower inventory movement.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Payables Turnover (Consolidated):</strong> 96.85 days (FY24) vs. 107.54 days (FY23). A decrease indicates faster payment to suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) (Consolidated, Calculated):</strong>
<ul>
<li>FY24: DSO (81.93) + DIO (108.96) - DPO (96.85) = <strong>94.04 days</strong>.</li>
<li>FY23: DSO (73.19) + DIO (92.64) - DPO (107.54) = <strong>58.29 days</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CCC has increased significantly, indicating a longer time span for capital to be tied up in working capital. This is driven by longer receivable collection periods and slower inventory movement, partially offset by faster payments to suppliers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Material cost as a percentage of total income dropped by 480 basis points due to lower input prices and better price realization, which can positively impact working capital by improving margins.</li>
