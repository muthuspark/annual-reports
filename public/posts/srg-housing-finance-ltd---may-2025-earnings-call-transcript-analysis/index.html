Analyst concern about increased credit cost (60bps), though management stated their overall credit cost has reduced (1.82% from 2.24%).

Past delays in getting administrative support for SARFAESI actions, which is now improving. Market Uncertainties: # General economic volatility is a perennial factor in the finance industry.
