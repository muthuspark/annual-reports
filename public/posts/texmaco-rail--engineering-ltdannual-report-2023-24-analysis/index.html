</h3>
<p>Texmaco Rail &amp; Engineering Limited reported a significant improvement in its financial performance for FY24 compared to FY23.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> Increased to ₹3,50,287.01 lakhs in FY24 from ₹2,24,327.74 lakhs in FY23, a growth of approximately 56.15%.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Profit (PBIDT):</strong> Stood at ₹28,952 lakhs in FY24, a substantial increase from ₹13,938 lakhs in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Before Tax (PBT):</strong> Reached ₹17,870 lakhs in FY24, a marked improvement from ₹2,529 lakhs in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT):</strong> Rose significantly to ₹11,269 lakhs in FY24 from ₹1,970 lakhs in FY23.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Margins:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Profit Margin (Standalone):</strong> Improved to 3.22% in FY24 from 0.88% in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit Margin (Standalone):</strong> Increased to 8.27% (PBIDT/Revenue) in FY24 from 6.21% in FY23.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS) (Standalone, Face Value ₹1):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic EPS:</strong> Increased to ₹3.27 in FY24 from ₹0.61 in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Diluted EPS:</strong> Increased to ₹3.27 in FY24 from ₹0.61 in FY23.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dividend:</strong> The Board has recommended a dividend of 50% (₹0.50 per equity share of ₹1 each) for FY24, a significant increase from 15% (₹0.15 per equity share) in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (Standalone):</strong> Improved to 5.88% in FY24 from 1.48% in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Capital Employed (Standalone):</strong> Increased to 8.00% in FY24 from 4.23% in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Equity Ratio (Standalone):</strong> Improved significantly to 0.26 times in FY24 from 0.73 times in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Coverage Ratio (Standalone):</strong> While the specific calculation method in the report shows 1.3 times for FY24 vs. FY23, the substantial increase in PBT relative to finance costs (₹17,870 lakhs PBT vs ₹13,195 lakhs finance costs) suggests an improved ability to service interest payments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The financial performance in FY24 demonstrates a strong recovery and growth phase for the Company. The substantial increase in revenue and a more than proportional increase in profitability indicate improved operational efficiency, better capacity utilization, and potentially favorable market conditions. The significant reduction in the debt-equity ratio points to a strengthened balance sheet.</p>

<li><strong>Preferential Allotment:</strong> Raised approximately ₹50 crore by allotting 33,78,375 equity shares at ₹145 each to the Promoter and Promoter group.</li>

<li><strong>Impact on Share Capital:</strong> Paid-up share capital increased from ₹32,18,69,895 as of March 31, 2023, to ₹39,94,67,302 as of March 31, 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Rating:</strong> Upgraded from &lsquo;CARE BBB+&rsquo; to &lsquo;CARE A-&rsquo; by CARE Ratings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Company has proactively strengthened its capital base through significant equity infusion.

<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sale of Goods: Recognized when significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, and the amount can be reliably measured.</li>
<li>Construction Contracts (Ind AS 115): Recognized over time by measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligation, based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date to total estimated cost. This involves significant judgment. Variable consideration is included when reasonably estimable and reversal is improbable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (PPE):</strong> Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis as per Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, except for certain assets where useful life is based on technical expert reports.

<ul>
<li>The Company (and its Indian subsidiaries/JVs) used accounting software that, for the Holding Company and most subsidiaries/JVs, did not have a feature of recording an audit trail (edit log) facility. However, the auditors noted management&rsquo;s representation that the software does not allow editing or deletion of transactions, thus transactions cannot be tampered with.</li>
<li>One jointly controlled entity&rsquo;s auditor (not L.B. Jha &amp; Co.) reported that while their software had an audit trail feature, it was not enabled/operated for a brief period (April 1, 2023, to April 10, 2023).</li>
<li>The auditors state that reporting on the preservation of audit trail as per statutory requirements is not applicable for FY ended March 31, 2024, as the proviso to Rule 3(1) of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 is applicable from April 1, 2023.</li>
