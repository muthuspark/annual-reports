</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Total Income demonstrated consistent growth, reaching ₹1,249.81 crore in FY24, up 11.79% YoY from ₹1,117.98 crore in FY23.  This follows the positive trend from FY22, indicating sustained top-line expansion driven by increased sales volumes (up 16.55% YoY in FY24 to 42,305 MT) across domestic and export markets. The 5-year CAGR for Total Income stands at 23.99%.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong> EBITDA grew 17.39% YoY to ₹177.72 crore in FY24 (₹151.38 crore in FY23). Profit After Tax (PAT) saw a significant increase of 53.32% YoY, reaching ₹90.20 crore in FY24 (₹58.83 crore in FY23).

  Business Segment Performance
  <a class="anchor" href="#business-segment-performance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Pitti Engineering operates primarily across two verticals: Rotating Electrical Equipment and Machined Components.</p>
<h4 class="heading" id="rotating-electrical-equipment">
  Rotating Electrical Equipment
  <a class="anchor" href="#rotating-electrical-equipment">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This segment, the traditional core, includes electrical laminations (loose, pole, glued), sub-assemblies (stator cores, rotor packs, shafts), and value-added products like ready-for-winding (RFW) assemblies. The company is India&rsquo;s largest manufacturer and exporter of electrical laminations. Performance is driven by demand from power generation (hydro, thermal, wind), railways, industrial motors, appliances, and emerging sectors like EVs and data centers (DG sets). The acquisition of Bagadia Chaitra (16,000 MT capacity) significantly boosts capacity in this segment, targeting growth particularly in South India. FY24 capacity utilization for components &amp; assemblies was 72.95%.</p>
<h4 class="heading" id="machined-components">
  Machined Components
  <a class="anchor" href="#machined-components">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This newer, high-growth vertical leverages the company&rsquo;s engineering and machining capabilities (including casting, fabrication, heat treatment, CNC machining). It produces complex, critical components like stator frames, gear cases, axle boxes, flywheel flanges, and parts for mining (OHV wheel hubs, support seals) and renewable energy (electrolyzer parts). This segment is margin-accretive and diversifies the end-user base (Railways, Metro, Mining, Renewables). Capacity utilization for Machined Components (based on hours) was high at 90.47% in FY24. The proposed merger with Pitti Castings Private Limited aims to further vertically integrate this segment, enhance control over casting quality, reduce related-party transactions, and bring in marquee clients.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The company demonstrates consistent growth across assets, equity, and liabilities over the three years. Asset growth is driven by increases in both current and non-current assets, indicating expansion in operations and capacity (evident from increased CWIP and PPE). Liabilities have grown faster than equity, particularly non-current liabilities in FY24, reflecting increased borrowings to fund expansion. Equity growth is supported by retained earnings.</p>

<p><em>Source: Annual Report FY24, pp. 8-9, 41, 48, 111, 113, 120-126.</em></p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> FY24 saw significant capital expansion reflected in CWIP and increased debt (Non-Current &amp; Current Borrowings), leading to a higher Debt-Equity ratio and lower DSCR. Profitability (PAT, EBITDA) showed strong growth despite increased finance costs, driven by higher revenue. Increases in Other Assets (Current &amp; Non-Current) point towards higher advances and receivables related to operations and capex.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Growth:</strong> Total Income (Standalone) for FY24 stood at ₹1,249.81 crore, an increase of 11.79% from ₹1,117.98 crore in FY23. Revenue from Operations (Standalone) grew by 9.22% YoY to ₹1,201.60 crore. Consolidated Revenue from Operations was ₹1,201.60 crore.</li>
<li><strong>Geographical Breakdown (Standalone - FY24):</strong>
<ul>
<li>India: ₹774.32 crore (64.44% of Revenue from Operations)</li>
<li>Outside India: ₹427.27 crore (35.56% of Revenue from Operations)</li>
<li>Export revenue contributed 36% to total turnover.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Segment/Product Breakdown (Standalone - FY24 Turnover %):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Electrical Laminations and Stampings: 64.94%</li>
<li>Machining of Metal Components: 18.96%</li>
<li>Others (Metal scrap, traded goods, tools): 16.10%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Growth Drivers:</strong> Growth was driven by increased sales volumes (up 16.55% YoY to 42,305 MT) supported by demand from domestic infrastructure projects (Railways - Vande Bharat, freight corridors) and resilient export markets (Mining, Renewable Energy, Data Centres). Focus on value-added products contributed positively.</li>

  Cost Structure Analysis (Standalone - FY24)
  <a class="anchor" href="#cost-structure-analysis-standalone---fy24">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost of Materials Consumed:</strong> Remained the largest cost component at ₹804.30 crore, constituting approximately 64.35% of Total Income (FY23: ~69.94%). This slight decrease as a percentage of income suggests potential efficiency gains or product mix changes.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefit Expenses:</strong> Increased to ₹108.68 crore (8.70% of Total Income) from ₹89.62 crore (8.02% of Total Income) in FY23, reflecting workforce expansion (from 1331 to 1502 employees).</li>
<li><strong>Finance Costs:</strong> Stood at ₹47.99 crore (3.84% of Total Income), slightly higher than ₹44.66 crore (3.99% of Total Income) in FY23, likely due to increased borrowings to fund capex and working capital.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation &amp; Amortization:</strong> Increased to ₹54.02 crore (4.32% of Total Income) from ₹44.68 crore (3.99% of Total Income) in FY23, driven by significant capex incurred.</li>
<li><strong>Other Expenses:</strong> Increased to ₹104.12 crore (8.33% of Total Income) from ₹78.54 crore (7.02% of Total Income) in FY23. Major components include Power &amp; Fuel (₹15.45 Cr), Stores &amp; Spares consumption (₹21.20 Cr), and Packing Costs (₹15.08 Cr).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> Increased by 17.39% YoY to ₹177.72 crore in FY24 from ₹151.41 crore in FY23 (calculated as PBT + Finance Costs + Depreciation).</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA Margin:</strong> Improved to 14.22% in FY24 from 13.54% in FY23 (Page 8 shows 14.79% vs 13.76%, likely including Other Income adjustments or slightly different calculation base). The trend shows margin improvement despite cost pressures. Blended EBITDA per metric tonne was ₹42,008.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Before Tax (PBT) Margin:</strong> Increased to 9.75% (₹121.91 Cr / ₹1249.81 Cr) in FY24 from 7.09% in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT) Margin:</strong> Showed significant improvement, increasing to 7.22% (₹90.20 Cr / ₹1249.81 Cr) in FY24 from 5.26% in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Margins have shown resilience and improvement, particularly PAT margin, reflecting operational efficiencies, focus on value-added products, and potentially favourable product mix/pricing adjustments offsetting input cost increases.</li>

  Operating Leverage
  <a class="anchor" href="#operating-leverage">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The significant increase in PAT (53.32% YoY) on an 11.79% YoY growth in Total Income indicates positive operating leverage.</li>
<li>While Cost of Materials is largely variable, substantial fixed/semi-fixed costs (Employee Benefits, Depreciation, portions of Other Expenses) allow profitability to increase at a faster rate than revenue once fixed costs are covered.</li>
<li>Investments in capacity expansion and automation (reflected in higher depreciation and capex) contribute to the fixed cost base but are expected to drive future efficiency and profitability as utilization increases.</li>

<ul>
<li>The financial statements are prepared as per Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), which is the applicable GAAP in India.</li>
<li>No specific non-GAAP measures requiring reconciliation were presented, apart from EBITDA, which is commonly used. EBITDA can be reconciled from the P&amp;L: PBT (₹121.91 Cr) + Finance Costs (₹47.99 Cr) + Depreciation &amp; Amortization (₹54.02 Cr) = ₹223.92 Cr. (Note: The reported EBITDA on page 8 is ₹177.72 Cr, calculated as PBT before Finance Costs and Depreciation/Amortization per page 48, which is ₹225.92 Cr - Finance Costs ₹47.99 Cr = ₹177.93 Cr, aligning closely. The difference might be minor definitional nuances).</li>

<p>OCF before working capital changes improved to ₹21,590.86 lakhs in FY24 from ₹16,885.28 lakhs in FY23, driven by higher Profit Before Tax (PBT) (₹12,191.29 lakhs vs ₹7,988.49 lakhs). However, Net OCF decreased significantly to ₹7,008.11 lakhs in FY24 compared to ₹22,202.55 lakhs in FY23. This reduction was primarily due to substantial negative working capital changes of ₹(13,186.22) lakhs in FY24, compared to a positive contribution of ₹8,617.27 lakhs in FY23, mainly reflecting increased investments in inventories and receivables alongside faster payments to suppliers.</p>
