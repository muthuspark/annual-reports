Working capital movements also influenced OCF, with notable changes in trade payables, trade receivables, and inventories. Income taxes paid amounted to ₹639 Crores.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow (ICF):</strong> Net cash used in investing activities was substantial at ₹3,027 Crores. Key activities included the purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (₹165 Crores) and significant net investment in bank deposits with maturities over three months (Net outflow of ₹7,154 Cr inflow vs ₹6,513 Cr outflow = ₹641 Cr net outflow from this specific activity, although the summary shows a much larger net figure likely due to large gross flows not fully detailed). Interest received contributed ₹303 Crores.</li>

<li><strong>Description:</strong> Risks affecting the long-term strategy, market position, and achievement of business objectives, stemming from external market dynamics and internal strategic choices.</li>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High. Macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties are explicitly mentioned as shaping investment trends and impacting growth. Failure to adapt to megatrends like digitalization and sustainability could significantly impact long-term viability.</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High. Global economic uncertainties, inflation volatility, geopolitical tensions, and rapid technological shifts (Digitalization, AI, Sustainability) are presented as active factors influencing the business environment.</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Ongoing/Uncertain. While India shows resilience, global uncertainties persist. The pace of technological and sustainability transitions is accelerating.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversified Portfolio:</strong> Operating across 23 market segments with different growth cycles enhances resilience against sector-specific downturns (p. 46, 143).</li>
<li><strong>Market Focus:</strong> Aligning with high-growth segments (Data Centers, Renewables, Electronics, Automation, Energy Transition) driven by megatrends and government policies (p. 9, 44-45, 143, 148).</li>
<li><strong>Localisation Strategy:</strong> &lsquo;Local for local&rsquo; approach and strong local supply chain reduces dependency and tariff risks (p. 10, 44, 46, 143).</li>
<li><strong>Innovation &amp; Adaptation:</strong> Continuous introduction of new products (IE4/IE3 motors, ACH180 drive, free@home®, ChloroStar™) tailored to local needs and market trends (p. 25, 145).</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Partnerships &amp; Alliances:</strong> Collaborations with NAMTECH, Witt India, PwC India, IIT Bombay to enhance capabilities in key areas like robotics, ventilation, digital transformation, and R&amp;D (p. 29, 145).</li>
<li><strong>Brand Positioning:</strong> Repositioning (&lsquo;Engineered to Outrun&rsquo;) to align with customer needs for efficiency and sustainability (p. 5, 9, 51).</li>
<li><strong>ERM Process:</strong> Holistic identification and management of risks impacting strategic objectives (p. 54-55, 153).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Implied high effectiveness demonstrated by record financial performance (orders, revenue, margins), consistent CAGR (20% topline over 5 years), and doubling of bottom-line (4 years) despite market dynamics (p. 9, 19, 57). Agility in navigating cycles is noted (p. 46).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition (Fixed Price Contracts):</strong> Recognition using the percentage of completion method involves significant judgment and estimation regarding total contract costs, costs to completion, and evaluation of operational/contractual risks. This area is critical due to its significance and focus as a key performance indicator. (Ref: Note 2.3a, 2.6, Auditor&rsquo;s Report Pg 201)</li>
<li><strong>Recoverability of Trade Receivables:</strong> Assessing the recoverability of significant trade receivables requires critical evaluation, including specific customer assessments and applying the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model under Ind AS 109, involving significant judgment.

Specifically, the audit trail (edit log) feature was not enabled at the database layer for the primary accounting software (excluding receipts/payments) for the period Jan 1, 2024, to Apr 22, 2024. Additionally, the auditor could not comment on the enablement for software related to journal entries (third-party provider with no independent report) and customer/vendor master data due to lack of evidence. The back-up of the audit trail for the database layer (receipts/payments) was noted as not being maintained on a server physically located in India.
