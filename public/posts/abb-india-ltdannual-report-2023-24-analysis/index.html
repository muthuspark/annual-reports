Working capital movements also influenced OCF, with notable changes in trade payables, trade receivables, and inventories. Income taxes paid amounted to â¹639 Crores.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow (ICF):</strong> Net cash used in investing activities was substantial at â¹3,027 Crores. Key activities included the purchase of Property, Plant, and Equipment (â¹165 Crores) and significant net investment in bank deposits with maturities over three months (Net outflow of â¹7,154 Cr inflow vs â¹6,513 Cr outflow = â¹641 Cr net outflow from this specific activity, although the summary shows a much larger net figure likely due to large gross flows not fully detailed). Interest received contributed â¹303 Crores.</li>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> Net cash used in financing activities was â¹730 Crores, dominated by dividend payments (â¹730 Crores) and payments for lease liabilities (principal â¹40.14 Cr, interest â¹5.43 Cr).</li>

<li><strong>Recoverability of Trade Receivables:</strong> Assessing the recoverability of significant trade receivables requires critical evaluation, including specific customer assessments and applying the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model under Ind AS 109, involving significant judgment.
