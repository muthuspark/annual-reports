</h3>
<p>While not explicitly termed &ldquo;sustainability investments,&rdquo; MCMIL has undertaken significant capital projects with environmental and operational efficiency benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CCL Capacity Enhancement (Completed April 2022):</strong> Upgraded from 39,000 MTPA to 86,000 MTPA (120% increase). This involved upgrading the electrical automation system and installing a new thermal incinerator for improved fuel efficiency. The ROI is increased production of high-value-added products and reduced fuel costs.</li>
<li><strong>Conversion of Galvanizing Line to Alu-Zinc Coating (Ongoing, expected completion FY 2025):</strong> This technological upgrade aims to produce a superior product (Alu-Zinc Coated Steel) offering enhanced durability (reportedly up to four times longer life) and commanding a market premium. The project is expected to increase the plant&rsquo;s coated product capacity by 36%, to a total of 180,000 MTPA. The ROI is anticipated through higher-margin products, increased production capacity, and enhanced market competitiveness.</li>
<li><strong>New Cold Rolling Complex and Second Appliance-Grade Colour Coating Line (Planned):</strong> These projects are aimed at backward integration and further capacity enhancement, contributing to the overall coated product capacity target of 180,000 TPA.</li>
</ol>
