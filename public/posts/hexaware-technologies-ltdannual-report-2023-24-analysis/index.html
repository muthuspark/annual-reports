  Strategic Initiatives &amp; Progress
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-initiatives--progress">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI-First Transformation:</strong> A key strategic shift initiated in FY2023 and scaled in FY2024. Focus on integrating GenAI, ML, and automation internally and into client solutions. Over 15,000 employees achieved GenAI certifications. Development of proprietary frameworks (Decode=AI &amp; Encode=AI) and platforms (Tensai®, RapidX™, Amaze®) to drive AI adoption. Strategic partnerships with AI leaders (AI21 Labs, Cohere, NVIDIA) established.</li>
<li><strong>Platform-Driven Solutions:</strong> Continued investment and enhancement of core platforms:
<ul>
<li><strong>Amaze®:</strong> Accelerates cloud/data migration and modernization, delivering cost savings (reported 60-75% savings in specific cases) and handling multi-cloud complexity. Enhanced with AI Co-Pilots.</li>
<li><strong>Tensai®:</strong> Drives automation for IT ecosystem modernization, focusing on agility, efficiency, and experience. Enhanced with GenAI solutions like Contact Center Co-Pilot and Document Management.</li>
<li><strong>RapidX™:</strong> Leverages GenAI to accelerate software engineering, maintenance, and legacy modernization using virtual SMEs and AI agents. A key differentiator for legacy system transformation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A):</strong> Acquired Softcrylic in FY2024, a data consulting firm, enhancing capabilities in data analytics and marketing technology. Acquired Mobiquity in FY2019 to strengthen digital customer experience design and cloud-native development.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Expansion:</strong> Scaled operations in Tier-2 Indian cities (Dehradun, Coimbatore, Ahmedabad) and established new delivery centers in Sri Lanka and Abu Dhabi. Expanded presence in Germany. Formed a joint venture with Novelty Group for Middle East expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Talent Development:</strong> Significant focus on upskilling, particularly in GenAI (15,000+ certifications), cloud, and domain-specific areas through HexaVarsity, SONIC platform, Mavericks &amp; Segue programs. Maintained industry-best voluntary attrition rate (10.8% for IT services line).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="risk-landscape--mitigation">
  Risk Landscape &amp; Mitigation
  <a class="anchor" href="#risk-landscape--mitigation">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity &amp; Data Privacy:</strong> Acknowledged as a critical risk. Mitigation includes a zero-trust approach, advanced security tools (EDR, SSE, SIEM, VAPT), adherence to frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS), ISO certifications (27001, 22301), supplier security protocols, regular audits, and employee training. Global data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA, DPDP Act) is actively managed.</li>
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition &amp; Retention:</strong> Risk identified due to high demand for new-age skills (AI, Cloud). Mitigation involves expanding into Tier-2 cities, robust employee referral programs, campus hiring (Mavericks, Segue), continuous upskilling via HexaVarsity &amp; SONIC, strong R&amp;R programs (including the &lsquo;Navigator&rsquo; long-service awards), and fostering an inclusive, employee-first culture (&lsquo;WEAVE&rsquo; engagement program).</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Concentration:</strong> Top 10 clients contributed 35.8% of revenue (down from 35.5% in FY2023). Americas contributed 74.0% of revenue. Mitigation involves geographic diversification (focus on Europe, APAC, Middle East) and expanding the client base while deepening relationships with existing large clients (USD 20Mn+ accounts grew from 3 to 14 in four years; first USD 100Mn+ account secured in FY2024).</li>
<li><strong>Economic &amp; Geopolitical Uncertainty:</strong> Acknowledged ongoing risks (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions). Mitigation focuses on operational efficiency, cost management, prudent financial policies, and geographic/service diversification.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Exchange Fluctuations:</strong> Significant revenue earned in foreign currency exposes the company to rate risks. Mitigation involves a structured hedging program approved by the Board, using foreign currency forward contracts based on a graded approach considering time horizons.</li>

As a percentage of revenue, this decreased from 67.2% in FY23 to 65.4% in FY24, indicating improved employee cost efficiency relative to revenue growth.

<ul>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA:</strong> Adjusted EBITDA increased by 23.2% YoY to INR 20,765 million in FY24 from INR 16,852 million in FY23. The Adjusted EBITDA margin improved significantly by 111 basis points (bps) to 17.3% in FY24 from 16.2% in FY23. This improvement was attributed to better price realization, operational efficiencies, a favorable offshore revenue mix, a streamlined pyramid structure, and optimized labor footprint through expansion into Tier 2 locations.</li>
<li><strong>Profit Before Tax (PBT):</strong> PBT grew 23.0% YoY to INR 15,603 million in FY24 from INR 12,675 million in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT):</strong> PAT increased by 17.7% YoY to INR 11,740 million in FY24 from INR 9,976 million in FY23. The PAT margin was 9.8% in FY24 compared to 9.6% in FY23, showing a slight improvement.</li>

<h3 class="heading" id="operating-leverage">
  Operating Leverage
  <a class="anchor" href="#operating-leverage">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The data indicates operating leverage. Revenue grew by 15.4%, while Adjusted EBITDA grew faster at 23.2%, and PBT grew at 23.0%. This suggests that as revenue increases, profits (before certain costs like tax and interest) increase at a faster rate, likely due to efficiencies gained and controlled cost growth relative to revenue expansion. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin from 16.2% to 17.3% further supports this observation.</p>

<li><strong>Employee Costs:</strong> Included non-recurring employee benefit/severance costs (INR 465m vs INR 66m in FY23) and ERP Transformation costs (INR 468m vs NIL in FY23).</li>
<li><strong>Other Expenses:</strong> Included ERP Transformation costs (Travel: INR 25m, Legal/Professional: INR 258m, Software Licenses: INR 107m - compared to varying amounts or NIL in FY23), Acquisition related costs (INR 334m vs INR 75m), and IPO related costs (INR 7m vs NIL). Provision for onerous vendor contracts related to lease agreements (INR 76m vs NIL) and regulatory fees (INR 170m vs NIL) were also noted. FY23 included specific provisions for onerous vendor contracts (INR 140m for communication, INR 58m for miscellaneous) and lifetime expected credit loss (INR 323m) which were not repeated at the same scale or nature in FY24.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation/Amortization:</strong> FY23 included accelerated amortization on ROU assets (INR 233m) due to office optimization, not specified for FY24. Amortization of intangibles from business combinations was INR 754m in FY24 vs INR 578m in FY23.</li>

<p>The report emphasizes Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance indicator.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reported EBITDA (FY24):</strong> INR 18,058 million</li>
<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> ESOP Cost (INR 454m), Exceptional Items (INR 1,740m), Other Income excl. FX gain/loss (INR 518m)</li>

<p>The Group generated INR 15,480 million from operations in FY24, a slight increase from INR 15,156 million in FY23. This was primarily driven by Profit Before Tax of INR 15,603 million, adjusted for non-cash charges like depreciation &amp; amortization (INR 2,788 million) and employee stock option costs (INR 353 million). Working capital adjustments included a significant outflow from increased trade receivables and other assets (INR -4,347 million), partially offset by inflows from increased trade payables, other liabilities, and provisions (INR 3,718 million). OCF conversion stood at 82.3% of reported EBITDA, indicating healthy operational cash generation despite working capital pressures.</p>

<p>Relating this FCF to the approximate market capitalization at the time of the IPO (February 2024, ~INR 430,000 million), suggests an FCF yield of approximately 3.3% (14,147 / 430,000).</p>
