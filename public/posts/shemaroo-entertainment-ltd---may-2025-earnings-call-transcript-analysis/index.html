Adjusted EBITDA (after adjusting for new initiative investments): Q4 FY25: ₹17 crores (approx.). FY25 (Adjusted EBITDA Loss): ₹29 crores (approx.). Accelerated Inventory Charge-offs: A significant factor impacting margins and profitability.

Traditional Media Revenues: Q4 FY25: ₹148 crores (approx. 3.3% YoY growth). FY25: ₹433 crores (approx. 9.69% YoY decline). Debt Reduction: Reduced by ₹37 crores in FY25. Revised Guidance or Forecasts # Debt Reduction: On track to reduce debt by ₹100 crores in two years (FY25 &amp; FY26), implying a target of ~₹63 crores reduction in FY26. However, this is subject to re-evaluation. Accelerated Inventory Charge-offs: Expected to continue in FY26 at a similar rate as FY25, with FY26 being the last year for this accelerated process. Areas of Growth or Decline # Growth: Digital media revenue (FY25: &#43;11% YoY). Positive EBITDA in Q4 FY25 after six quarters. Decline: Overall revenue (FY25: -3% YoY), Traditional media revenue (FY25: -9.69% YoY), primarily due to TV syndication business. Significant EBITDA and Net Loss for FY25, heavily impacted by inventory charge-offs and new initiative investments. Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategic Announcements # Accelerated Inventory Charge-offs: A strategic initiative started five quarters ago, significantly impacting current profitability but aimed at cleaning the books. FY26 will be the last year of this accelerated process. Acquisition of Aikyam: To gain end-to-end control of broadcast licenses for ShemarooTV, Shemaroo Umang, and Shemaroo Marathi Bana, fortifying the business and offering nominal cost savings. Focus on Balance Sheet Strengthening &amp; Operational Efficiency: Key focus for the next fiscal year. New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed # ShemarooMe Gujarati: Released 13 new titles in Q4 FY25 (movies, web series, plays), including digital world premieres and original web series. YouTube: Shemaroo FilmiGaane crossed 71 million subscribers; over 10.5 billion views across portfolio channels in Q4 FY25. Broadcasting: Two original shows released in Q4 (Bade Haveli Ki Choti Thakurain, Jamuniya). Deiveegam (Tamil Devotional Service): Launched as a paid subscription service with Tata Play (DTH platform), not a standalone channel. Significant Operational Changes # Cost Rationalization Measures &amp; Investment Strategy Realignment: Being undertaken in response to market dynamics, particularly the return of major GECs to Free Dish. No New Channel Launches Planned: Due to market changes with “big four GECs” entering Free Dish. Ongoing or Completed Projects # Channel Breakeven Status: One channel broke even ~1.5 years ago, another is near breakeven. Shemaroo Umang is the primary channel requiring substantial investment. Chumbak TV has not broken even but shows a positive outlook. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Insights about Industry Trends # Consolidation in Broadcasting: Negatively impacted Shemaroo’s TV syndication business. Subdued Advertising Outlook: Expected in the near term due to macroeconomic pressures, geopolitical tensions, and major sporting events (IPL), particularly for non-sports categories. Return of Major Broadcasters (GECs) to Free Dish Platform: Expected to affect viewership across categories and lead to redistribution of advertising spends. Direct-to-Mobile (D2M) Technology: Viewed as a potential new distribution mechanism for existing apps/content rather than a standalone revenue model changer for Shemaroo. Competitive Positioning Statements # Actively monitoring market impacts and realigning investment strategy. Chumbak TV is one of the few channels not impacted by the entry of big four broadcasters on Free Dish. Market Challenges or Opportunities Mentioned # Challenges: Subdued ad environment, increased competition on Free Dish, decline in TV syndication. Opportunities: Growth in digital media, potential for B2B licensing business to recover in FY26. Positive outlook for Chumbak TV. Comments about Market Share or Positioning # Broadcasting GEC channels have a viewership share of around 8.2% in the overall Hindi GEC genre. Risk Factors &amp; Challenges # Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management # Margin Pressure: Expected to continue due to ongoing accelerated inventory charge-offs. Decline in TV Syndication Business: Significant impact on FY25 topline due to industry consolidation. Challenging Advertising Environment: Near-term outlook remains subdued. Impact of Major GECs on Free Dish: Affecting viewership and ad spends, requiring strategic realignment. Regulatory Issues Mentioned # US Tariff on Films: Management believes it is unlikely to have a major impact on Shemaroo, as it’s likely aimed at US-produced films shot abroad or new releases, not catalog content or foreign films in general. Industry bodies are examining and preparing representations. Supply Chain or Operational Constraints # Not explicitly detailed as supply chain issues, but the TV syndication decline due to industry consolidation represents an operational constraint on a key revenue stream. Statements about Market Uncertainties # Overall advertising outlook Download Transcript">
