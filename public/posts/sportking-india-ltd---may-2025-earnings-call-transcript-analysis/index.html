Strong improvement in all profit margins (Gross, EBITDA, PAT) both YoY and QoQ for Q4, and YoY for FY25. Debt Reduction: Significant deleveraging. Debt-to-equity ratio from 0.97x in March ‘24 to 0.58x in the March ‘25. Interest cost during the quarter was down by 44% and pre-tax interest coverage improved to 4x in FY ‘25 compared to 2.6x in FY ‘24. Capacity Utilization: Remained high at 96% in Q4 FY25 (same as Q4 FY24) and around 95% for the full year. Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategic Announcements # Merger of Group Companies: Two group companies (into dyeing and retailing of garments) are being merged, expected to be completed within this financial year. Future Growth Cycle &amp; Capex: Exploring various options for next growth cycle and will share news on that front soon. New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed # Focus on increasing captive consumption post-merger. Significant Operational Changes # Raw Material Procurement: Softer input costs due to staggered schedule of raw material procurement has enabled margin expansion. Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) providing 60 days interest-free credit, impacting inventory on books. Ongoing or Completed Projects # Deleveraging: Significant reduction in borrowings. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Insights about Industry Trends # Textile industry operating at a steady pace. India’s textile and apparel exports saw a 6.32% increase, driven by a 10% surge in apparel exports. Cotton prices have remained range bound with less volatility. CCI holds significant stock (100 lakh bales). Cotton yarn spreads continue to be influenced by encouraging demand and has marginally improved over the previous quarter. Renewed interest in the Indian textile sector. Potential trade deals with U.S.A., Europe, and U.K. are seen as a watershed moment for textile industry. Xinjiang cotton ban: Most of Xinjiang cotton is used for their own domestic consumption. Indian cotton can substitute it. Competitive Positioning Statements # Indian textile sectors have emerged as marginal favorites, and better placed compared with some of the most prominent Asian textile brands. Sportking is well positioned to serve both domestic and export demand. Sportking has a premium standing in whatever yarn they make amongst competitors. Capacity utilization has also been among the best in the industry. Market Challenges or Opportunities Mentioned # Challenges: MSP operations and import duty on cotton. Opportunities: Current scenario presents an opportunity for the existing Indian players to capitalize and capture some global market share. Impending trade deals are a major opportunity. Comments about Market Share or Positioning # The focus on export growth and readiness for trade deals suggests an aim to increase global market presence. Risk Factors &amp; Challenges # Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management # MSP Operations. Import Duty on Cotton. Tariff Uncertainty. Regulatory Issues Mentioned # Import duty on cotton. US tariffs on imports. Supply Chain or Operational Constraints # Running at full capacity (95-96%). Bangladesh land route blockage for Indian yarn. Statements about Market Uncertainties # Regarding guidance, “So there are so many moving parts right now. So we cannot commit for a longer term, longer future.” Tariff effects: “While the full effect of tariffs remain an uncertainty…” Forward-Looking Statements # Outlook and Future Projections # Expect to maintain double-digit EBITDA margins. Cotton prices to remain stable. Potential for margin expansion if import duty on cotton is removed. Domestic demand expected to improve. Commitments or Targets Set by Management # Debt reduction. Merger completion: Expected within this financial year. Planned Investments or Strategic Priorities # Exploring capex. Scaling up merged businesses (dyeing and garmenting). Sentiment about Future Performance # Generally optimistic. Q&amp;A Insights # Most Pressing Analyst Questions # Sustainability of current EBITDA levels and future guidance. Timeline and mechanics of the group company merger. Outlook for domestic market and raw material pricing. Impact of US tariffs and Xinjiang cotton ban. Cotton yarn spreads. Capex plans given high utilization. Potential for achieving 15-16% operating margins. Management’s Responses to Challenging Questions # Guidance: Avoided specific guidance but expressed expectation of double-digit EBITDA margins. Merger Mechanics: Assured “no outflow of cash from the Company.” Margin Potential: Confirmed that 15%&#43; margins are possible if Indian cotton prices align with international prices. Identify any questions that were evaded or answered indirectly # Specifics of capex plans were deferred. Precise future percentage of captive yarn consumption post-merger was not quantified. New Information Revealed During Q&amp;A # Current cotton yarn spreads are around 135. Specialty cotton yarn constituted about 25-30% of yarn sales last year. No significant pre-buying from US retailers ahead of tariffs was observed. Bangladesh remains the biggest export market and is stable. Blockage of Indian yarn at Bangladesh land routes affected only 5-10% of their exports to the region. CCI offers 60 days interest-free credit for cotton, affecting inventory on books. Management Tone &amp; Sentiment # Overall Tone # Confidently optimistic but cautious. Areas Where Management Seems Particularly Confident or Concerned # Confident: Export performance and potential. Operational efficiency and market standing. Potential benefits from international trade realignments and deals. Concerned (or areas highlighted as headwinds): Domestic cotton pricing. Policy issues: MSP operations and the import duty on cotton. Summary of Most Important Takeaways # Strong Financial Rebound: Reported robust financial performance for Q4 FY25 and FY25, with significant improvements in revenue, profitability, and margins. EBITDA margins are back in double digits (10.4% for FY25, 11.8% for Q4 FY25). Export-Led Growth: Exports were a key driver, constituting 52% of FY25 sales and showing strong YoY growth. Significant Deleveraging: Substantially reduced its debt. Strategic Mergers &amp; Future Capex: Merger of two group companies is underway to enhance vertical integration, expected to complete within FY26. Capex plans for the “next growth cycle” are being finalized. Optimistic Market Outlook (with Caveats): Optimistic about the Indian textile sector, particularly with potential trade deals. However, domestic MSP operations and high import duties on cotton remain key challenges. Removal of cotton import duty could push operating margins towards 15%&#43;. Operational Efficiency: Continues to operate at high capacity utilization. Cautious on Guidance: Specific guidance was withheld due to market dynamism and policy uncertainties. Download Transcript">

  Summary of Most Important Takeaways
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary-of-most-important-takeaways">#</a>
</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong Financial Rebound:</strong> Reported robust financial performance for Q4 FY25 and FY25, with significant improvements in revenue, profitability, and margins. EBITDA margins are back in double digits (10.4% for FY25, 11.8% for Q4 FY25).</li>
<li><strong>Export-Led Growth:</strong> Exports were a key driver, constituting 52% of FY25 sales and showing strong YoY growth.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Deleveraging:</strong> Substantially reduced its debt.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Mergers &amp; Future Capex:</strong> Merger of two group companies is underway to enhance vertical integration, expected to complete within FY26. Capex plans for the &ldquo;next growth cycle&rdquo; are being finalized.</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic Market Outlook (with Caveats):</strong> Optimistic about the Indian textile sector, particularly with potential trade deals. However, domestic MSP operations and high import duties on cotton remain key challenges. Removal of cotton import duty could push operating margins towards 15%+.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Continues to operate at high capacity utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Cautious on Guidance:</strong> Specific guidance was withheld due to market dynamism and policy uncertainties.</li>
</ol>
