<p>Minda Corporation Limited reported a consolidated revenue of â¹46,511 million for FY2024, an 8.2% increase year-on-year (YoY) from â¹43,001 million in FY2023. This growth was primarily driven by robust domestic demand in the two-wheeler (2W) and passenger vehicle (PV) segments. Q4 FY2024 revenue reached â¹12,150 million, a 13.1% YoY increase.</p>
<p>EBITDA for FY2024 rose by 11.5% to â¹5,144 million from â¹4,615 million in FY2023. The EBITDA margin improved to a record high of 11.1% in FY2024 from 10.7% in FY2023, attributed to enhanced operational efficiencies from smart automation and component localization. Q4 FY2024 EBITDA was â¹1,386 million with a margin of 11.4%.</p>
<p>Profit After Tax (PAT) for FY2024 saw a modest 4% growth to â¹2,272 million. The PAT margin slightly decreased to 4.9% in FY2024 from 5.1% in FY2023, impacted by higher finance costs and depreciation stemming from investments in capacity expansion and technological upgrades.</p>

  Overall Financial Performance

</h3>
<p>Minda Corporation Limited demonstrated resilient financial performance in FY2023-24. Consolidated revenue grew by 8.2% year-on-year (YoY) to â¹46,511 million, primarily driven by robust domestic demand in the two-wheeler (2W) and passenger vehicle (PV) segments, which offset challenges in export markets and subdued demand in the ASEAN region. Standalone revenue saw a 10.08% YoY increase to â¹38,445 million.</p>
<p>EBITDA surged by 11.5% YoY to â¹5,144 million, with the EBITDA margin improving to a record 11.1% from 10.7% in FY2023. This margin expansion is attributed to enhanced operational efficiencies achieved through strategic automation and component localization initiatives.</p>
<p>Consolidated Profit After Tax (PAT) for FY2024 was â¹2,272 million, a decrease of 20.14% from â¹2,845 million in FY2023. The PAT margin stood at 4.9%, down from 5.1% in the previous fiscal, influenced by higher finance costs and depreciation stemming from investments in capacity expansion and technological upgrades. Standalone PAT decreased by 21.65% to â¹1,885 million.</p>
<p>A significant achievement was the reduction in net debt from â¹3,910 million in FY2023 to â¹1,560 million in FY2024, leading to an improved net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08x (down from 0.25x). This reflects effective cash flow management and strategic debt repayments. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) for FY2024 was robust at 20.0%.</p>
<p>Shareholders experienced capital appreciation of approximately 47.5% (share price from ~â¹216.10 in April 2023 to ~â¹417.70 in March 2024). The Board recommended a total dividend of â¹1.40 per share for FY24 (70% payout), compared to â¹1.20 per share in FY23.</p>

<li><strong>Innovation and R&amp;D:</strong> Investment in R&amp;D reached approximately 3% of revenue (â¹1,122 million) in FY24. The company filed 26 new patents, bringing the total to over 270. Key focus areas include Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), digital instrument clusters, and Electric Vehicle (EV) components like DC-DC converters and battery chargers. The Spark Minda Technical Centres (SMIT) in Pune and Bangalore, with over 700 engineers, are central to these efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Electric Vehicle (EV) Focus:</strong> 30% of new business orders in FY24 originated from the EV sector, indicating strong traction for products like smart keys, DCDC converters, and battery chargers. A significant â¹7,500 million order for battery chargers was secured. The lifetime order book exceeded â¹1,00,000 million, with over 30% from the EV segment.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity Expansion and Global Footprint:</strong> Key developments include the establishment of a smart key facility in Vietnam and greenfield projects for die casting, instrument clusters, and smart key production in India. The company operates 27 manufacturing facilities in India and 2 overseas.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Partnerships:</strong> A 50:50 Joint Venture was formed with HSIN Chong Machinery Works Co. Ltd. (HCMF) of Taiwan for manufacturing automotive sunroofs and closure systems in India. A strategic alliance was also established with a Japanese player for smart vehicle access systems, securing an order from a leading Indian 2W OEM.</li>

This was significant due to the variety of shipment terms impacting timing and the significant judgment and estimates involved in calculating price variations (volume-based discounts, price adjustments). Audit procedures included evaluating accounting policies against Ind AS 115, testing controls over revenue recognition timing and price variation calculations, testing sales transactions around year-end, and assessing the adequacy of disclosures.</li>

<h4 class="heading" id="key-accounting-policies">
  Key Accounting Policies
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-accounting-policies">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basis of Preparation:</strong> Financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis (except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments, and defined benefit liabilities measured at fair value) in accordance with Ind AS.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition (Ind AS 115):</strong> Revenue is recognized when control of goods is transferred to the customer, measured at the consideration expected, adjusted for discounts, incentives, etc. A 5-step methodology is applied. Significant judgments include identifying distinct performance obligations, determining transaction price (fixed vs. variable, significant financing component), allocating transaction price, and determining if performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):</strong> Carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives (e.g., Factory buildings: 30 years; Plant &amp; Machinery: 5-15 years; Vehicles: 4 years). Useful lives are reviewed annually.</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong> Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Other intangibles (software, brands) are amortized over their useful lives (typically 5 years).</li>
<li><strong>Impairment of Non-Financial Assets:</strong> Assessed at each reporting date for indicators of impairment. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average basis) and net realizable value.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong> Classified and measured at amortized cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) based on business model and contractual cash flow characteristics. Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied for impairment of financial assets.</li>
<li><strong>Leases (Ind AS 116):</strong> Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized for leases. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed on a straight-line basis.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Benefits:</strong> Defined contribution plans (Provident Fund) are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit plans (Gratuity) are provided based on actuarial valuation using the Projected Unit Credit Method; remeasurements are recognized in OCI.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Currency Transactions:</strong> Translated at exchange rates prevailing on transaction dates. Monetary assets/liabilities are restated at year-end rates, with exchange differences generally recognized in profit or loss. For foreign operations, assets/liabilities are translated at year-end rates, income/expenses at transaction date rates/average rates, and translation differences to OCI.</li>
<li><strong>Business Combinations:</strong> Accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill is the excess of consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired.</li>
<li><strong>Changes in Accounting Policies/New Standards:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Amendments to Ind AS 8 (Definition of Accounting Estimates), Ind AS 1 (Disclosure of Accounting Policies - material vs. significant), and Ind AS 12 (Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction) were applicable. The company stated these amendments did not have a material impact on the financial statements, though Ind AS 1 amendments impacted disclosures.</li>
