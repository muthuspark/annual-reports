<p>FY24 saw significant growth in several key financial metrics. Revenue from operations increased by 9.88%, driven by improved sales across segments despite a flat overall CV market. Profit Before Tax (PBT) and Profit After Tax (PAT) experienced substantial growth (70.24% and 83.05% respectively), indicating enhanced operational efficiency, cost management, and better price realization. The increase in Non-Current Investments and Current Loans reflects strategic capital allocation and expanded financing activities by its subsidiary. The rise in borrowings, both non-current and current, supported the company&rsquo;s growth initiatives and working capital needs.</p>

  Working Capital Trends (Consolidated)

<p>Net working capital increased significantly in FY24, driven by a substantial rise in current assets, particularly cash and cash equivalents and loans (from the financing subsidiary), outpacing the growth in current liabilities. The Current Ratio improved, indicating enhanced short-term liquidity. Inventory turnover saw a slight moderation, while debtor turnover remained relatively stable. The increase in operating profit margin suggests improved operational efficiency, contributing to better working capital management despite overall growth.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone (FY24):</strong> Net cash from operating activities stood at â¹2,708.64 Crores, a decrease from â¹2,738.08 Crores in FY23. The reduction was primarily driven by an increase in net working capital by â¹1,523 Crores (FY23: â¹105.99 Crores decrease), despite a higher profit from operations after tax (â¹4,026.29 Crores vs â¹2,562.51 Crores). Key working capital adjustments included an interim dividend remittance of â¹1,453.48 Crores, increased inventories (â¹415.86 Crores), and reduced trade payables (â¹868.24 Crores), partially offset by reduced trade receivables (â¹494.80 Crores).</li>
<li><strong>Consolidated (FY24):</strong> Net cash used in operating activities was â¹6,099.76 Crores, a significant increase from â¹4,068.92 Crores used in FY23. This was despite a higher profit for the year (â¹2,917.13 Crores vs â¹1,431.05 Crores). The primary driver was a substantial increase in net working capital requirements, particularly a â¹9,151.87 Crore increase in non-current and current financial assets (primarily loans related to the financing subsidiary) and a â¹1,453.48 Crore interim dividend remittance.</li>

<li><strong>Standalone (FY24):</strong> Net cash inflow from investing activities was â¹901.79 Crores, a significant turnaround from a net outflow of â¹1,129.58 Crores in FY23. This was mainly due to proceeds from the sale of current investments (net) of â¹2,602.45 Crores (FY23: purchase of â¹1,586.64 Crores) and inter-corporate deposits repaid by subsidiary (net) of â¹104.90 Crores.

<li><strong>Consolidated (FY24):</strong> Net cash inflow from financing activities was â¹8,129.12 Crores, up from â¹7,051.72 Crores in FY23.

<ul>
<li><strong>Debtors Turnover:</strong> Standalone debtors turnover ratio remained relatively stable at 10.04 times in FY24 compared to 10.05 times in FY23. This indicates consistent efficiency in collecting receivables. Trade receivables (net) decreased from â¹4,049.51 Crores in FY23 to â¹3,554.71 Crores in FY24 (Standalone).</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Turnover:</strong> Standalone inventory turnover ratio decreased to 8.76 times in FY24 from 10.70 times in FY23, suggesting a slowdown in inventory movement. Total inventories (Standalone) increased to â¹3,038.90 Crores in FY24 from â¹2,623.04 Crores in FY23, primarily due to higher finished goods inventory (â¹1,564.62 Crores vs â¹1,140.28 Crores). Consolidated inventories also rose to â¹4,103.98 Crores from â¹3,290.34 Crores.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Payables Turnover:</strong> Standalone trade payables turnover ratio improved slightly to 4.86 times in FY24 from 4.67 times in FY23. However, total trade payables (Standalone) decreased to â¹6,207.51 Crores in FY24 from â¹7,075.75 Crores in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Current Ratio:</strong> Standalone current ratio slightly decreased to 0.94 in FY24 from 1.02 in FY23. Consolidated current ratio was 0.98 in FY24, down from 1.09 in FY23.</li>
<li><strong>Working Capital:</strong> Standalone operating profit before working capital changes was â¹4,026.29 Crores. However, adjustments for changes in working capital led to a net outflow of â¹1,317.65 Crores (excluding dividend remittance effect), indicating increased investment in working capital during FY24. Consolidated figures show even larger working capital absorption, primarily due to the expansion of the financing business.
