  Capital Allocation Strategy
  <a class="anchor" href="#capital-allocation-strategy">#</a>
</h3>
<p>SRG&rsquo;s capital allocation strategy is focused on fueling business growth and strengthening its financial position.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding Business Growth:</strong> The primary use of capital is to meet projected business growth, augment long-term resources for funding requirements, and support working capital needs. This is evident from the proposed QIP of up to ₹100 crores and the increase in authorized share capital from ₹16 crores to ₹20 crores.</li>
<li><strong>Equity Infusion:</strong> Actively seeking to infuse additional capital through mechanisms like Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) to support expansion and maintain capital adequacy. The resolution to raise up to ₹100 crores via QIP underscores this.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend Policy:</strong> The Directors have consistently (as mentioned for the current year) opted to retain earnings to be ploughed back into the business for future growth and shareholder wealth augmentation, rather than declaring dividends.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Stock Options (ESOPs):</strong> Introduced ESOP Scheme 2023 to enable employee participation in future growth, aligning employee interests with shareholder value. This represents an allocation of potential equity.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion and Infrastructure:</strong> Capital is also allocated towards physical expansion (new branches) and technological upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Prudential Norms:</strong> A portion of capital is inherently allocated to meet regulatory requirements like CRAR.</li>
