  <meta property="og:description" content="Earnings Call Transcript Analysis Report # Triveni Turbine Limited Q3 &amp; 9M FY25 Earnings Analysis # Financial Performance # Key Metrics: Q3 FY25 Revenue: ₹5.03 billion (record high), &#43;17% YoY. Q3 FY25 Domestic Sales: ₹2.5 billion, &#43;5% YoY. Q3 FY25 Export Sales: ₹2.5 billion, &#43;31% YoY. (Export share: 49% vs 44% YoY). Q3 FY25 EBITDA: ₹1.31 billion (record high), &#43;30% YoY. Margin: 26.1% (&#43;270 bps YoY). Q3 FY25 PAT: ₹926 million, &#43;36% YoY. 9M FY25 Revenue: ₹14.7 billion (record high), &#43;23% YoY. 9M FY25 Domestic Sales: ₹7.8 billion, &#43;20% YoY. 9M FY25 Export Sales: ₹6.9 billion, &#43;25% YoY. (Mix: 53:47 Domestic:Export). 9M FY25 EBITDA: &#43;38% YoY. Margin: 25.7% (&#43;280 bps YoY). 9M FY25 PAT: ₹2.6 billion. Order Book &amp; Booking: Q3 FY25 Order Booking: ₹5.26 billion (largely flat YoY). Domestic subdued, Export &#43;9% YoY to ₹3.46 billion (66% of Q3 booking). 9M FY25 Order Booking: ₹17.3 billion, &#43;20% YoY. Domestic -3% YoY to ₹6.6 billion, Export &#43;41% YoY to ₹10.7 billion (62% of 9M booking). Closing Order Book (Dec 31, 2024): ₹18.19 billion (record high), &#43;15% YoY. Domestic ₹6.4 billion (-22% YoY), Export ₹11.8 billion (&#43;55% YoY, 65% of total). Segment Performance: Product (Q3): Order Booking ₹4 billion (&#43;6% YoY), Turnover ₹3.3 billion (&#43;14% YoY). Product (9M): Order Booking ₹12.8 billion (&#43;30% YoY), Turnover ₹9.7 billion (&#43;21% YoY). Aftermarket (Q3): Order Booking ₹1.3 billion (-17% YoY), Turnover ₹1.8 billion (record high, &#43;22% YoY). Management confident in future growth despite Q3 booking dip. Dividend: Interim dividend increased by 54% to ₹2 per share (200% face value). Guidance/Forecasts: No explicit revision, but management expresses strong confidence in maintaining robust performance in the medium term, supported by the order book and diversification. Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # CO2-Based Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES): Received Notice of Award from NTPC for a 160 MWh LDES system at Kudgi plant. Contract Value: Approx. ₹2.9 billion. Scope: Full EPC (Design, Engineering, Fabrication, Erection, Commissioning, Testing). Technology: CO2 thermodynamic transformation in a closed loop, using an indigenously developed sub-critical CO2 turbine by Triveni. Collaboration with Energy Dome. Goal: Provide grid stabilization, support renewable energy integration. Seen as an “alternate revenue stream” with significant future potential. R&amp;D and Technology: Increased investment planned in R&amp;D (manpower, capital for testing infrastructure). Focus areas: Allied CO2 systems (supercritical, transcritical), steam cycle efficiency enhancement, cost reduction (modularisation, supply chain efforts). Developing digital services as future revenue streams. Global collaborations with universities and design houses are ongoing. Market Expansion &amp; Operations: U.S. Market: Significant investment phase, incurring incubation costs (loss &gt; ₹200 million factored in FY25). Focus on building capabilities, getting certifications, driving service/refurbishment/product sales. Initial signs seen as “very, very encouraging,” with breakthrough orders in Q4. SADC (South Africa): Aftermarket presence established, contributing to reduced power outages for utility clients. Order value decreased, but value-add (parts business) and margins are improving. Aftermarket Strategy: Focus shifting to higher value-add refurbishment and parts business for own and third-party turbines globally. Aiming to leverage workshop facilities in India, U.S., and SADC region. Capacity Expansion: Planning an additional bay at the Sompura facility for manufacturing and R&amp;D test beds to cater to increased volumes and new products. Capex expected to increase beyond historical levels. People Strategy: Strong focus on hiring, training, and capacity building to support growth and innovation. High demand noted for capable service engineers. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Industry Trends: Strong demand in renewable energy (waste-to-energy, biomass). Oil &amp; Gas (API market) investment is robust. Industrial heat and power market favors decentralized generation. Sustainable energy transition seen as an opportunity, not a threat, due to fuel-agnostic heat capture technology. Competitive Positioning: Domestic market share estimated around 50%. Acknowledges intense competition domestically, sometimes leading to backing off on price-sensitive deals. U.S. market is more competitive than SADC, with established OEMs and third-party providers. Global Aftermarket share estimated very low indicating significant headroom for growth. Market Challenges/Opportunities: Domestic: Subdued Q3 order finalization despite a strong enquiry pipeline. Market size saw degrowth in 9M FY25. Q4 recovery hoped for but cautious outlook due to elections. Export: Strong growth driver, diversifying geographical risk. New geographies and applications contributing. U.S. presents a large, dynamic, but bureaucratic market opportunity. Geopolitics/Tariffs: Management feels “quite agnostic” due to localisation capabilities and largely indigenous supply chain. Market Sentiment: Overall positive, driven by export strength, aftermarket potential, and new technology initiatives (CO2). Domestic market softness is the main current concern. Risk Factors &amp; Challenges # Domestic Market Slowdown: Acknowledged subdued order booking in Q3 and overall market degrowth in 9M FY25. Uncertainty around the pace of recovery in Q4/near term. Competitive Intensity: High competition, particularly domestically, can pressure pricing and requires focus on value differentiation over price. U.S. Market Entry Challenges: Bureaucratic hurdles (permits, certifications) slowing down ramp-up compared to SADC entry. Incurring initial losses (“incubation costs”). Download Transcript">
