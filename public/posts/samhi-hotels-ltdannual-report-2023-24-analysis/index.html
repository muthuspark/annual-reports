  Financial Performance Analysis (FY2022-FY2024)

</h4>
<p>SAMHI Hotels Ltd. demonstrated a significant operational turnaround and revenue growth trajectory over the FY2022-FY2024 period. Total Income surged from â¹3,107 million in FY2022 to â¹7,614 million in FY2023, and further to â¹9,787 million in FY2024, representing a YoY growth of 145.1% and 28.5% respectively. This growth was driven by improved occupancy, higher average room rates (ARR), and the strategic acquisition of the ACIC portfolio in August 2023. On a pro-forma basis (including full-year ACIC impact), FY2024 Total Income reached â¹10,527 million compared to â¹9,644 million in FY2023.</p>
<p>EBITDA (pre-ESOP and one-time expenses) showed strong recovery and growth, moving from â¹218 million (6.5% margin) in FY2022 to â¹2,632 million (34.6% margin) in FY2023, and reaching â¹3,484 million (35.6% margin) in FY2024. Pro-forma EBITDA (pre-ESOP and one-time) for FY2024 stood at â¹3,681 million, up from â¹3,273 million in FY2023, indicating underlying operational strength and successful integration benefits from the ACIC portfolio, whose EBITDA margins improved from 30% pre-acquisition to 37.5% in Q4 FY2024.</p>
<p>Portfolio RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) consistently improved, from â¹1,805 in FY2022 to â¹3,777 in FY2023 and â¹4,132 in FY2024. Same-store RevPAR for FY2024 grew by 17% YoY. This reflects strong demand in key commercial markets.</p>
<p>Despite operational improvements, the company reported net losses: (â¹4,364) million in FY2022, (â¹3,386) million in FY2023, and (â¹2,346) million in FY2024. The reduction in losses in FY2024 was aided by increased operating profit and a significant decrease in finance costs from â¹5,014 million in FY2023 to â¹3,948 million in FY2024, primarily due to debt reduction post-IPO. The successful IPO in FY2024, raising â¹12,000 million in fresh equity, was pivotal in recapitalizing the company and reducing debt.</p>

<p>SAMHI Hotels Ltd. aims to be a leading branded hotel ownership and asset management platform in India. Key strategic pillars include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity Expansion in Key Markets:</strong> Focus on owning hotel capacity in prime commercial and office markets across India, across different price points. Progress is evident through a portfolio of 31 operating hotels (4,801 rooms) in 13 major cities. The acquisition of the ACIC portfolio in FY2024 added 25% to inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition and Turnaround:</strong> Acquire underperforming hotel assets with significant repositioning potential at a discount to replacement cost. The company highlights successful turnarounds, including the ACIC portfolio where EBITDA margins improved from 30% pre-acquisition to 37.5% in Q4 FY2024.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Partnerships:</strong> Leverage strong partnerships with global hotel brands (e.g., Marriott, Hyatt, IHG) to access customers, loyalty programs, and management expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Data-Driven Asset Management:</strong> Utilize its proprietary platform, SAMHIintel, for analytics-based asset management to enhance financial and operational performance.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Prudence &amp; PAT Growth:</strong> Achieve investable surplus and PAT growth. The successful IPO in FY2024 was a key step, enabling a material reduction in debt and finance costs. Total income on a pro-forma basis crossed â¹10 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress in FY2024 includes a 17% RevPAR growth for &lsquo;same store&rsquo; hotels, a 28.5% increase in total income to â¹9,787 million, and a 32.4% rise in consolidated EBITDA (pre-ESOP and one-time expenses) to â¹3,484 million (reported basis).

<li><strong>Strategic Brand Alliances:</strong> Partnerships with 8 global brands (Marriott, Hyatt, IHG etc.) provide access to established distribution channels, loyalty programs, and operational best practices, enhancing market penetration and guest acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Prime Locations:</strong> A strong presence in high-density business locations, key urban consumption centers, and office markets (e.g., Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi-NCR, Pune) with high barriers to entry ensures consistent demand from business travelers.
