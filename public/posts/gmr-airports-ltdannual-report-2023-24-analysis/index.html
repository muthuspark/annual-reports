  Long-Term Strategic Goals and Progress
  <a class="anchor" href="#long-term-strategic-goals-and-progress">#</a>
</h3>
<p>GMR Airports Infrastructure Limited (GIL) is strategically focused on strengthening its position as a leading global airport platform. Key long-term goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidation and Simplification:</strong> The merger of GMR Airports Limited (GAL) and GMR Infra Developers Limited (GIDL) with GIL, effective July 25, 2024 (appointed date April 1, 2023), is a significant step. This aims to simplify the corporate structure, bringing public shareholders closer to airport assets and enhancing shareholder value. Groupe ADP has become a co-promoter as a result.</li>
<li><strong>Organic Growth through Capacity Expansion:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delhi (DIAL) &amp; Hyderabad (GHIAL):</strong> Major expansion projects are substantially complete, increasing Delhi&rsquo;s capacity to 100 million passengers per annum (MPPA) and Hyderabad to 34 MPPA. This positions them to capture anticipated traffic growth.</li>
<li><strong>Goa (GGIAL - Mopa):</strong> Manohar International Airport, commissioned in FY23, handled 4.4 MPPA in FY24. Expansion to 7.7 MPPA is ~90% complete.</li>
<li><strong>Bhogapuram (GVIAL):</strong> Construction commenced in December 2023, with ~30% physical progress by June 2024. Expected COD is December 2026. NIIF has committed INR 675 crores (INR 395 crores received).</li>
<li><strong>Crete, Greece:</strong> Construction is progressing, with COD expected by February 2027.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio Rationalization and International Expansion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Divestment of stake in Mactan Cebu International Airport (MCIA), Philippines, is ongoing while retaining technical service provision.</li>
<li>Successful bid and operational takeover of Kualanamu International Airport, Medan, Indonesia.</li>
<li>Actively seeking new airport concessions in India, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Middle East, Eastern/Central Europe, and Africa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Airport Adjacency Business Development:</strong> A critical growth strategy involves building capabilities in Retail (including Duty-Free, F&amp;B), Cargo, Car Parking, Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M), and Project Management Consultancy (PMC) services. This leverages existing airport development expertise. A JV with Travel Food Services (TFS) has been formed for F&amp;B concessions.</li>
<li><strong>Airport Land Development (ALD):</strong> Moving up the real estate value chain from land leasing to self-development initiatives (office spaces, terminal hotels, retail) at Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa to maximize monetization potential.</li>
<li><strong>Digitalization and Innovation:</strong> Enhancing passenger experience and operational efficiency through digital transformation (e.g., AOCC to APOC using AI, DigiYatra deployment, self-service facilities) and fostering innovation via GMR Innovex. Cybersecurity remains a key focus with a 24x7 Integrated Cyber Defense Center.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability (ESG):</strong> Commitment to Net Zero by 2030. Delhi Airport achieved ACI Level 5 (Net Zero), and Hyderabad Airport ACI Level 4+. Initiatives include clean energy transition (150,000 tCO2 saved at Indian airports), EV adoption, biodiversity conservation, and studies on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).</li>
<li><strong>Financial Strengthening:</strong> Focus on improving liquidity and balance sheet strength through strategic fundraising at both corporate and asset levels to support growth and reduce liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress is evident in project completions/advancements, successful commissioning of new assets, strategic partnerships (Groupe ADP, NIIF), and initial wins in adjacency businesses.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="competitive-advantages-and-market-positioning">
  Competitive Advantages and Market Positioning
  <a class="anchor" href="#competitive-advantages-and-market-positioning">#</a>
</h3>
<p>GIL possesses several competitive advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Leadership &amp; Scale:</strong> Largest private airport operator in Asia and 2nd largest globally, with a passenger handling capacity exceeding 189 MPPA. Operational airports (Delhi, Hyderabad, Goa) handle over one-fourth of India&rsquo;s domestic and over one-third of international traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Portfolio:</strong> Operates flagship airports like Delhi (India&rsquo;s largest) and Hyderabad (pioneering greenfield). Diversified portfolio includes greenfield (Goa, Bhogapuram, Crete), brownfield (Delhi, Hyderabad, Medan), and international assets.</li>
<li><strong>Proven Execution Capability:</strong> Demonstrated expertise in designing, building, and operating complex airport infrastructure, including large-scale expansions and greenfield developments, often adhering to high quality and ESG standards.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Partnership with Groupe ADP:</strong> This partnership provides financial strength, global operational expertise, access to best practices, and enhanced credibility for international bidding. Groupe ADP is now a co-promoter of GIL.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Airport Platform Model:</strong> Unique credentials across greenfield development, brownfield operations, and a rapidly developing suite of adjacency businesses (Retail, F&amp;B, Cargo, O&amp;M, PMC), offering a holistic airport ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Airport Land Development Expertise:</strong> Capability to develop and monetize large land parcels adjacent to airports (Aerocity concept in Delhi and Hyderabad), creating additional revenue streams and enhancing airport value.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Acumen:</strong> Demonstrated ability to raise significant capital through diverse instruments (equity, bonds, NCDs, FCCBs, CCDs) at both HoldCo and SPV levels, and form financial partnerships (e.g., NIIF).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Innovation &amp; Passenger Experience:</strong> Commitment to deploying technology (AI, DigiYatra, APOC) to enhance operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction, reflected in high ASQ scores and Skytrax rankings.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors position GIL strongly to capitalize on the high-growth Indian aviation market and selectively pursue global opportunities.</p>

<p>GIL is actively pursuing innovation and digitalization, driven by GMR Innovex, its innovation vertical.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Initiatives:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Airport Operations Center (APOC):</strong> Transitioning from AOCC to APOC, an integrated system using AI-enabled predictive and prescriptive analytics to streamline passenger handling and improve turnaround times. This involves collaboration with Groupe ADP.</li>
<li><strong>DigiYatra:</strong> Successful development and deployment of this facial recognition-based seamless travel experience at Indian airports.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Technologies:</strong> Implementation of self-service baggage drop and self-biometric kiosks integrated with immigration systems.</li>

Focus areas include e-boarding, image-based passenger processing, and full-body scanners. It also runs an &ldquo;Innovex Fellowship Program.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> A 24x7 Integrated Cyber Defense Center (ICDC) has been launched, with active monitoring and alignment of third-party cybersecurity. Successfully fended off a DDoS attack in May 2023.</li>
<li><strong>R&amp;D Focus:</strong> Appears to be more on applied innovation, process improvement, and technology adoption rather than fundamental research. The emphasis is on enhancing customer experience, operational efficiency, and revenue generation.</li>

  Company Overview and Strategic Transformation
  <a class="anchor" href="#company-overview-and-strategic-transformation">#</a>
</h3>
<p>GMR Airports Infrastructure Limited (GIL) is a global airport infrastructure developer and operator with a significant presence in India and expanding international operations. FY 2023-24 was marked by the strategic merger of GMR Airports Limited (GAL) and GMR Infra Developers Limited (GIDL) into GIL, effective July 25, 2024 (appointed date April 1, 2023). This simplifies the corporate structure, aligns public shareholders with airport assets, and establishes Groupe ADP as a co-promoter (32.3% stake post-merger, with GMR Group holding 33.8% and public 33.9%). The merger and recent FCCB conversions have expanded GIL&rsquo;s paid-up equity share capital to 10,55,89,75,952 shares, elevating its market capitalization to over INR 1 lakh Crore (as of July 31, 2024). The company is also progressing with a name change to GMR Airports Limited.</p>
<p>GIL operates major Indian airports including Delhi (DIAL), Hyderabad (GHIAL), and Goa (Mopa - GGIAL), collectively handling over one-fourth of India&rsquo;s domestic and one-third of its international traffic. International operations include Medan (Indonesia) and technical services to Cebu (Philippines), with greenfield projects under development in Bhogapuram (Andhra Pradesh, India) and Crete (Greece). The company is strategically expanding into airport adjacency businesses (retail, duty-free, F&amp;B, cargo, O&amp;M, EPC/PMC) and airport land development (Aerocity concepts).</p>

<h4 class="heading" id="financial-performance-consolidated">
  Financial Performance (Consolidated)
  <a class="anchor" href="#financial-performance-consolidated">#</a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> Increased by 31.18% to INR 8,754.56 crore in FY24 from INR 6,673.80 crore in FY23. This growth was driven by a surge in passenger traffic leading to higher aeronautical revenues, and increased contributions from non-aeronautical segments like duty-free, retail, F&amp;B, cargo, and hospitality.</li>
<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> Rose to INR 3,654.59 crore in FY24 from INR 2,423.57 crore in FY23, reflecting improved operational leverage and revenue growth.</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT) (Loss):</strong> The consolidated loss widened to INR (659.55) crore in FY24 from INR (57.04) crore in FY23, primarily due to increased finance costs (INR 2,830.16 Cr in FY24 vs INR 2,115.82 Cr in FY23) and higher depreciation &amp; amortization expenses (INR 1,611.01 Cr in FY24 vs INR 1,386.69 Cr in FY23) associated with significant capital expenditure on airport expansions and new projects. Exceptional items also played a role, with a net gain of INR 115.08 crore in FY24 compared to a gain of INR 816.41 crore in FY23 (which included gains from the Cebu stake sale).</li>
<li><strong>Balance Sheet Strengthening:</strong> GIL and its subsidiaries undertook significant fundraising activities. At the erstwhile GAL level (now merged), INR 5,000 crore was raised via senior unsecured bonds for refinancing, equity investment in Bhogapuram, buy-out of MAHB&rsquo;s 11% stake in GHIAL, and liquidity for new projects. DIAL raised INR 2,744 crore (NCDs), GHIAL INR 540 crore (NCDs), and GGIAL INR 2,475 crore (NCDs) for expansion, refinancing, and capex. GVIAL achieved financial closure for INR 3,215 crore.</li>
