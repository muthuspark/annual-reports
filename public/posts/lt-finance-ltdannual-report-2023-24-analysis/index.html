</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macroeconomic Headwinds:</strong> The global economy faced slowdowns, high interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts. India, while resilient (FY24 GDP growth est. 7.6%, FY25 projected 7.0% by RBI), faces risks from geopolitical tensions, climate events, delayed private capital spending, and prolonged high interest rates. A potential adverse impact on rural income (key for LTF&rsquo;s rural portfolio) due to skewed monsoons, despite an &ldquo;above normal&rdquo; prediction for 2024, remains a concern.</li>
<li><strong>Retailisation and Portfolio Mix:</strong> LTF has aggressively pursued its &ldquo;Lakshya 2026&rdquo; goal of retailisation, achieving 94% by FY24 (vs. target &gt;80%). The wholesale book was reduced by 72% YoY to â¹5,528 Cr. The strategy&rsquo;s success depends on sustained growth and asset quality in the expanded retail (Rural &amp; Urban) book (now &gt;â¹80,000 Cr).</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Landscape (Fintech@Scale):</strong> LTF aims to be a &ldquo;Fintech@Scale.&rdquo; The risk involves execution of digital transformation, fending off agile fintech competitors, and adapting to evolving customer expectations for digital services. Investment in technology, AI, and Gen AI is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Merger Integration:</strong> Successful completion of the merger into a &ldquo;Single Lending Entity&rdquo; (effective Dec 4, 2023) simplifies structure but carries integration and operational synergy realization risks.</li>

  Mitigation Strategies &amp; Control Effectiveness:

</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lakshya 2026 Strategy:</strong> Early achievement of retail-level targets (Retailisation 94%, Retail Book Growth 31% YoY, Retail RoA 3.17% for Q4FY24) indicates strong strategic execution. New consolidated targets set (Retailisation &gt;95%, Retail Book CAGR &gt;25%, Consolidated GS3 &lt;3%, NS3 &lt;1%, RoA 2.8-3.0% by FY26).</li>
<li><strong>5-Pillar Execution Strategy:</strong> Focus on customer acquisition, credit underwriting, digital architecture, brand visibility, and capability building. Quantifiable progress reported in Q4FY24 on new customer acquisition (12.29 lakh) and channel expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Diversified Portfolio:</strong> Balanced rural and urban focus (each ~â¹40,000 Cr) provides resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Transformation:</strong> Significant investments in PLANET app (91 lakh+ downloads, 4.3-4.4 star ratings), 100% digital disbursements in key products, and process re-engineering.</li>

<h4 class="heading" id="potential-financial-impact">
  Potential Financial Impact:

<p>Failure to achieve revised Lakshya targets could impact RoA (target 2.8-3.0%), PAT growth (FY24 PAT â¹2,320 Cr, +43% YoY), and market capitalization (â¹39,362.59 Cr as of Mar 31, 2024). Macroeconomic shocks could increase credit costs and reduce loan demand.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity &amp; Data Privacy:</strong> Increased digitalisation and customer-facing applications heighten cyber-attack risks (ransomware, DoS, data breaches). Digital frauds targeting customers are noted as increasing. Reliance on AI/ML and cloud introduces new security vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Technology Infrastructure &amp; Business Continuity:</strong> Dependence on complex IT architecture for processing high transaction volumes. Failures could disrupt operations.</li>
<li><strong>Process Efficiency &amp; Human Error:</strong> Risks arising from system failures, human error, or internal fraud. Addressed through SOP reviews and automation (Project Overhaul 1.0 &amp; 2.0).</li>
<li><strong>Model Risk:</strong> Reliance on sophisticated algorithms (statistical, ML) for critical decisions (underwriting, valuation, collections, regulatory reporting). Flawed models can lead to incorrect decisions and financial loss.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party/Vendor Risk:</strong> Outsourcing IT operations or partnering with FinTechs introduces risks if vendor controls are inadequate.</li>

  Key Audit Matters (KAMs)
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-audit-matters-kams">#</a>
</h4>
<p><strong>Standalone Audit:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) on Retail Loan Assets:</strong>  Significant judgment and estimation uncertainty involved in classifying loan assets and applying measurement principles for ECL, given the materiality of retail loan assets (â¹76,497.78 crores, 94.02% of total assets).</li>
<li><strong>Information Technology (&lsquo;IT&rsquo;) Systems and Controls:</strong> The complex IT architecture supporting high-volume daily transactions necessitates robust IT general and application controls for reliable financial reporting.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Consolidated Audit:</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Impairment of Goodwill on Consolidation:</strong> Significant management judgment is required in the impairment assessment, particularly in estimating future cash flows, discount rates, and terminal growth rates for value-in-use calculations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The audit reports include an &ldquo;Other Matter&rdquo; paragraph clarifying that select indicators for FY23 were assured by a previous practitioner and that the FY23 comparatives have been restated due to the amalgamation effective April 1, 2023.</p>

  Key Accounting Policies and Changes
  <a class="anchor" href="#key-accounting-policies-and-changes">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) under the Companies Act, 2013. Key accounting policies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Combinations:</strong> The merger of L&amp;T Finance Limited, L&amp;T Infra Credit Limited, and L&amp;T Mutual Fund Trustee Limited with the Company (effective April 1, 2023) was accounted for as a common control business combination using the &ldquo;pooling of interest&rdquo; method. Assets and liabilities were recorded at their carrying amounts, and prior period information was restated.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong> Classified and measured based on contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model. Retail loan assets are primarily measured at amortised cost and are subject to ECL. The wholesale loan portfolio was reclassified to Fair Value Through Profit &amp; Loss (FVTPL) in FY23 due to a change in business model.</li>
<li><strong>Impairment (ECL):</strong> A three-stage model is used for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition (12-month ECL for Stage 1, lifetime ECL for Stage 2 and Stage 3). Significant judgment is involved in determining SICR, PD, LGD, and the impact of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Interest income is recognized using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Fee and commission income is recognized upon satisfactory completion of performance obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Leases (Ind AS 116):</strong> Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were <strong>no significant changes in accounting policies</strong> during FY24. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) did not notify any new standards or amendments applicable to the Company for FY24.</p>
