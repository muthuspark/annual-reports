  3-Year Trend Analysis (FY22-FY24)
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-year-trend-analysis-fy22-fy24">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Timken India Limited has demonstrated a consistent growth trajectory over the past three fiscal years. Total income grew from â¹22,058 million in FY22 to â¹28,598 million in FY23, and further to â¹29,503 million in FY24, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15.6%. This growth was primarily driven by domestic sales.</p>
<p>Profit After Tax (PAT) increased from â¹3,276 million in FY22 to â¹3,907 million in FY23, and marginally to â¹3,921 million in FY24 (CAGR of 9.4%). The PAT margin saw a slight compression in FY24 (13.48%) compared to FY23 (13.92%), influenced by changes in other income (absence of one-time gains from FY23) and a marginal increase in total expense ratio. Earnings Per Share (EPS) followed a similar trend, rising from â¹43.56 in FY22 to â¹51.95 in FY23 and â¹52.13 in FY24.</p>
<p>Total Equity has steadily increased from â¹16,015 million in FY22 to â¹20,374 million in FY23, and â¹24,173 million in FY24, reflecting strong retained earnings. The company maintains a very low debt profile, with Total Debt to Total Equity ratio at 0.25% in FY24, down from 1.45% in FY23 and 1.80% in FY22. Return on Equity (RoE) was robust at 17.61% in FY24, though lower than 21.15% in FY23 and 21.80% in FY22, impacted by the larger equity base and near-flat PAT growth in FY24. Capital employed grew from â¹17,327 million in FY22 to â¹21,336 million in FY23, and â¹25,118 million in FY24, supporting business expansion.</p>

<p>Timken India Limited demonstrated resilience in FY23-24, achieving modest revenue growth of 3.7% to â¹29,095 million, an all-time high. Profit After Tax (PAT) saw a marginal increase of â¹14 million to â¹3,921 million, with Earnings Per Share (EPS) slightly improving to â¹52.13 from â¹51.95 in the previous year. The performance was primarily driven by strong domestic demand, particularly in the rail sector, which experienced double-digit growth. This offset a decline in export sales attributed to a global market slowdown. The company maintained a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow, with cash and investments increasing by 23.9% to â¹4,887 million.</p>

  Economic and Market Environment

</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Outlook:</strong> The global economy is projected for steady but historically subdued growth (3.2% in 2024-2025, per IMF), impacted by high borrowing costs, geopolitical tensions (Ukraine, Red Sea crisis), and sluggish productivity. Inflation is expected to decline, potentially leading to interest rate reductions in major economies.</li>
<li><strong>Bearing Market:</strong> The global bearing market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% from $50.9 billion in 2024 to 2030. The roller bearings segment (over 45% revenue share in 2023) and the automotive segment (49% market share) dominate. The railway and aerospace segments are poised for the fastest growth. The Indian bearing industry constitutes approximately 3.5% of global demand.</li>
<li><strong>Indian Economy:</strong> India&rsquo;s economy expanded strongly at 8.4% in Q3 FY24, with projected GDP growth of 6.8% in 2024 (IMF). Growth is driven by government capital spending, domestic demand, and robust manufacturing and construction. India is expected to become the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest economy by 2025. Core inflation is at a 47-month low (3.53% in Jan 2024). Increased capex (â¹11.11 lakh crores for infrastructure) in the interim budget 2024-25 is a positive driver.</li>

Investments in mutual funds are at FVTPL.</li>
<li><em>Financial Liabilities:</em> Initially at fair value. Subsequently, most financial liabilities (trade payables, borrowings) are at amortized cost using the EIR method.</li>
