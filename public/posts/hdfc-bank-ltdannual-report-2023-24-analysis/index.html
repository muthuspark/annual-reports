<ul>
<li>Profit After Tax (PAT) surged by 37.9% YoY to ₹60,812.3 crore in FY24. Prior years showed consistent growth (FY23: ₹44,108.7 Cr, FY22: ₹36,961.3 Cr).</li>
<li>Net Interest Income (NII) grew 25.0% YoY to ₹1,08,532.5 crore in FY24, crossing the ₹1 lakh crore mark. Prior years also exhibited strong NII growth (FY23: ₹86,842.2 Cr, FY22: ₹72,009.6 Cr).</li>
<li>Core Net Interest Margin (NIM) stood at 3.53% in FY24, influenced by the merged entity&rsquo;s liability profile.</li>

<li>Total Advances grew 55.2% YoY to ₹24,84,862 crore in FY24, heavily influenced by the addition of the mortgage portfolio. Pre-merger growth was also robust (FY23: ₹16,00,586 Cr, FY22: ₹13,68,821 Cr).</li>
<li>Total Balance Sheet size increased by 46.7% YoY to ₹36,17,623 crore in FY24.</li>

<p>This segment saw substantial growth, particularly in advances (104.3% YoY), driven by the merger and continued leadership in personal loans, auto loans, and cards.
