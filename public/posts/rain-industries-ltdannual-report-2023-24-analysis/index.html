<p>Rain Industries Limited reported a decline in consolidated revenue from operations to ₹153,744 million in CY2024 from ₹181,189 million in CY2023, a decrease of approximately 15%. This was primarily driven by lower price realizations across segments, partially offset by increased volumes (notably in CPC) and favorable currency movements (USD/EUR appreciation against INR).</p>
<p>Operating profit (Adjusted) decreased to ₹14,981 million (9.7% margin) in CY2024 from ₹20,222 million (11.1% margin) in CY2023. The margin compression resulted from a lag in raw material cost resets relative to falling finished goods prices and higher operating costs.</p>
<p>The company reported an adjusted net loss after tax (attributable to owners) of ₹4,419 million in CY2024, compared to an adjusted net profit of ₹1,526 million in CY2023. Consequently, adjusted loss per share was ₹13.14 in CY2024 versus earnings per share of ₹4.54 in CY2023.</p>
<p>Despite weaker profitability, the Group generated free cash flow from operations due to reduced working capital deployment, enabling debt repayment of US$ 65 million (net, including FX impact).</p>

Operating profit margin contracted to 11.6% from 13.2% due to price/cost lag. Expected to return to normal margins with India import restrictions lifted.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Materials:</strong> Revenue increased by 4.5% to ₹33,786 million, driven by a 14% volume increase (higher throughput, demand). Operating profit margin improved to 7.6% from 4.7% due to higher volumes and favorable currency effects. Expected to perform better with HHCR plant stabilization and cost measures.</li>
<li><strong>Cement:</strong> Revenue decreased by 19% to ₹12,312 million due to lower price realization (-8%) and lower volumes (-12%). Capacity utilization decreased to 71% from 80%. Operating profit margin significantly decreased to 0.6% from 7.0% due to lower realizations and higher costs amidst market consolidation. Expected to perform better in 2025 driven by demand growth and cost-optimisation initiatives.</li>

</h3>
<p>CY2024 was challenging for Rain Industries, marked by revenue decline and significant margin compression, leading to a net loss. Performance varied by segment, with Advanced Materials showing improvement while Carbon and Cement faced headwinds. However, the company maintained positive operating cash flow, reduced debt, and anticipates improved performance, particularly in the Carbon segment due to regulatory relief in India, and in the Cement segment due to expected demand growth. Leverage metrics show some improvement, but liquidity tightened.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Consolidated revenue from operations declined by 15% to ₹153,744 million in CY 2024 from ₹181,078 million in CY 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by lower average price realizations across all segments, partially offset by increased volumes in the Carbon segment and appreciation of USD/EUR against INR.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Profit (Adjusted):</strong> Adjusted operating profit decreased to ₹14,981 million (9.7% margin) in CY 2024 from ₹20,090 million (11.1% margin) in CY 2023. The decline reflects margin compression due to a lag in the alignment of raw material costs with falling finished product prices, coupled with higher operating costs.</li>
<li><strong>Net Result (Adjusted):</strong> The Group reported an adjusted net loss attributable to owners of ₹4,419 million in CY 2024, a significant downturn from an adjusted net profit of ₹1,526 million in CY 2023. Consequently, adjusted loss per share stood at ₹13.14 compared to earnings per share of ₹4.54 in the prior year. Reported net loss was ₹5,643 million.</li>
<li><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> Despite the net loss, the Group generated positive free cash flow, attributed mainly to a reduction in working capital. This enabled strategic debt repayment.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend:</strong> An interim dividend of ₹1 per equity share (50% on face value ₹2) was declared and paid for CY 2024, consistent with the previous year.</li>
