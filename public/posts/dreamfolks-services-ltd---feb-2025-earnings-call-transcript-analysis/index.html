Comparison with Previous Periods # Q3 revenue grew YoY, but profitability metrics (Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, PAT, and related margins) declined YoY, primarily attributed to changes in volume mix due to banks’ spend-based programs and increased hiring costs for expansion. 9M revenue showed strong growth, while gross profit also grew. Adjusted EBITDA saw a slight increase, but margins contracted. PAT was marginally lower. Revised Guidance or Forecasts # Gross margin guidance for FY25 remains 11% to 13%. No specific revised revenue or PAT guidance for FY25 or FY26 was provided beyond outperforming industry growth. Areas of Growth or Decline # Growth: Revenue (Q3 &amp; 9M YoY), contribution from services other than India Airport lounge (increased to 6.9% in 9M FY25 from 5.2% in 9M FY24), client base (13 new enterprise clients, new banking clients). Decline/Pressure: Gross margins (Q3 YoY, though 9M FY25 in line with guidance), EBITDA margins (Q3 &amp; 9M YoY), PAT margins (Q3 &amp; 9M YoY). The primary reason cited for margin pressure was “structural change by our bank clients as part of the spend-based program implementation” and “hired top talent in India and out of India, which slightly impacted our margins.” Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategic Announcements # Focus on diversification across services, clientele, and geographies. Expansion of services beyond travel into lifestyle. New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed # New Services: Baggage Wrapping: Currently at 12 airports in India, expanding.

F&amp;B Outlets: 18 new F&amp;B outlets in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and 9 in India mentioned in Q&amp;A. Significant Operational Changes # Hiring top talent in India and outside India to support expansion. Banks increasing minimum spending thresholds on cards impacting volume mix. Ongoing or Completed Projects # Client Addition: Successfully added 13 enterprise clients, including MakeMyTrip and TBO. Also added new banking clients, some transitioning from competitors. Technology Platform: Continuous enhancement of proprietary, cloud-based technology platform. Clients leveraging platform for “spend-based options and other tools for existing products and new product launches.” Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Insights about Industry Trends # Air Traffic &amp; Credit Card Growth: Grew by 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively. India’s Travel Industry Outlook: Projected to grow at 6.9% annually and expand to $512 billion by 2028.
