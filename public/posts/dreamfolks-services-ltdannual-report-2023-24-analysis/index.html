</h3>
<p>Dreamfolks Services Ltd. has demonstrated substantial growth over the past three fiscal years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue from Operations:</strong> Increased to INR 11,350 million in FY24, a 47% YoY rise from INR 7,733 million in FY23. The company reported a revenue CAGR of 100.4% from FY22 to FY24, significantly outpacing domestic air traffic growth of 13% in FY24. FY22 revenue was approximately INR 2,830 million.</li>
<li><strong>Passengers (PAX) Facilitated:</strong> Grew from 3.5 million in FY22 to approximately 11 million in FY24, representing a CAGR of 77.2%. Digital channels (web access, self-check-in kiosks) accounted for ~10% of monthly passenger interactions in FY24.</li>
<li><strong>Gross Margin:</strong> Remained within guidance at 12.1% in FY24.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA:</strong> Reached INR 1,033 million in FY24, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.1%. The CAGR for Adjusted EBITDA from FY22 to FY24 was 102%. FY22 Adjusted EBITDA was approximately INR 253 million.</li>
<li><strong>Profit After Tax (PAT):</strong> Stood at INR 686 million in FY24, compared to INR 725 million in FY23. The PAT margin for FY24 was 6.0%, a decrease from 9.4% in FY23, attributed to higher costs of services offsetting revenue growth. The CAGR for PAT from FY22 to FY24 was 105.5%. FY22 PAT was approximately INR 162 million.</li>
<li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> Exhibited a CAGR of 69.6% from FY22 to FY24. As of March 31, 2024, Net Worth (Equity Share Capital + Other Equity) was approximately INR 2,370.8 million.</li>
<li><strong>Return on Equity (RoE):</strong> Was 34.9% in FY24, down from 60.6% in FY23. The decrease is attributed to a decline in profit disproportionate to the increase in Net Worth.</li>

<li>Employee benefit expenses as a percentage of revenue remained relatively stable.</li>

<p>Dreamfolks Services Ltd. operates in a dynamic environment characterized by rapid technological advancements, evolving consumer preferences in the travel and lifestyle sector, and a growing, but competitive, Indian market. Key risks identified revolve around strategic execution in diversification and global expansion, operational dependence on technology and third-party contracts, financial risks including credit and foreign exchange exposure, and compliance with a complex regulatory landscape. The company demonstrates a structured approach to risk management, with established internal controls and oversight from the Board and its committees. While revenue has grown significantly, profitability metrics like Net Profit Margin and RoNW have declined in FY24, warranting close monitoring. Cybersecurity and data protection remain paramount, alongside the challenge of talent retention and managing geopolitical uncertainties impacting the travel sector.</p>

  Executive Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#executive-summary-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dreamfolks Services Ltd. reported strong revenue growth in FY24, driven by increased passenger volumes and strategic expansion of its service portfolio beyond airport lounges. Revenue from operations surged 47% YoY to INR 11,350 million. However, profitability faced pressure, with Profit After Tax (PAT) declining to INR 686 million from INR 725 million in FY23, attributed to higher cost of services. Gross margins remained stable at 12.1%, within guidance, while adjusted EBITDA stood at INR 1,033 million (9.1% margin). The company is actively diversifying its offerings (e.g., railways, lifestyle services) and expanding geographically, aiming to increase revenue from non-Indian airport lounge services, which grew to 6% of total revenue. Technological advancements, strategic partnerships, and a focus on enhancing customer experience are central to its growth strategy. Key challenges include managing cost of services, market competition, and dependencies on the travel ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Growth:</strong> Consolidated revenue from operations increased by 46.8% to INR 11,350 million in FY24 from INR 7,733 million in FY23. This significantly outpaced the domestic air traffic growth of 13%, indicating market share gains and successful monetization of increased passenger footfall (~11 million PAX facilitated in FY24 vs. 3.5 million in FY22). The revenue CAGR from FY22 to FY24 was a robust 100%.</li>
<li><strong>Diversification Impact:</strong> Revenue from services beyond Indian airport lounges grew to 6% of total revenue in FY24, up from less than 2% in FY22. The company targets this segment to contribute 15-20% in the next 4-5 years, signaling a strategic shift and potential new growth avenues.</li>

<li><strong>EBITDA:</strong> Adjusted EBITDA reached INR 1,033 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.1%. The CAGR for Adjusted EBITDA (FY22-FY24) was 102%.</li>

<li>Standalone PAT: Decreased to INR 685.99 million in FY24 from INR 725.10 million in FY23.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Margin Contraction:</strong> Net Profit Margin (Standalone) declined to 6.0% in FY24 from 9.4% in FY23. This is attributed by management primarily to &ldquo;High costs of services during FY2024&rdquo; offsetting revenue growth. This indicates potential pressures from suppliers/lounge operators or increased costs associated with diversification and expansion. The long-term PAT CAGR (FY22-FY24) of 105.5% contrasts with the recent YoY decline.</li>
