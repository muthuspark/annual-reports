  Cash Flow Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#cash-flow-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<p><em>Based on Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow (OCF):</strong> Net cash inflow from operating activities stood at INR 2,686.43 million in FY24, a significant increase from INR 1,663.91 million in FY23. This growth was driven primarily by higher Profit Before Tax (INR 3,577.68 million vs INR 2,554.80 million) and favorable working capital adjustments, particularly increases in trade payables and other liabilities, offsetting increases in inventories and receivables.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow (ICF):</strong> Net cash outflow from investing activities was INR 1,972.57 million in FY24, compared to an inflow of INR 1,008.58 million in FY23. Key components include:
<ul>
<li>Purchase of Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (Capex): INR 367.76 million (FY23: INR 477.40 million).</li>
<li>Net increase in current investments: INR (1,118.52) million (FY23: INR 1,454.90 million inflow).</li>
<li>Investment in Bank Deposits (net): INR (1,361.13) million outflow (FY23: INR 10.70 million outflow).</li>
<li>Interest Received: INR 463.64 million (FY23: INR 312.28 million).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> Net cash outflow from financing activities was INR 782.25 million in FY24, significantly lower than the INR 2,650.31 million outflow in FY23. The primary driver in FY23 was the share buyback (INR 1,900 million). FY24 outflow mainly comprises dividend payments (INR 731.44 million) and lease liability payments.</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> Calculated as OCF minus Capex (Purchase of PPE), FCF for FY24 is INR 2,318.67 million (INR 2,686.43 million - INR 367.76 million). This represents approximately 86% of the Consolidated PAT (INR 2,694.58 million), indicating strong cash generation capability after reinvestment in fixed assets. (FY23 FCF was INR 1,186.51 million).</li>

Higher international sales and operational efficiencies contributed to margin expansion.</p>

</h4>
<p>Growth was driven by orders from renewable energy projects (Biomass, WtE, WHR), industrial customers, independent power producers (IPPs), and API turbines, particularly in international markets. The Aftermarket segment benefited from refurbishment orders (including other OEMs) and spares/services demand.</p>

</h4>
<p>The strong order intake provides healthy revenue visibility. The significant growth in export orders underscores the success of TTL&rsquo;s internationalization strategy. The Aftermarket segment is becoming increasingly crucial, contributing substantially to both orders and revenue, driven by a wider service portfolio including refurbishment.</p>

  Auditor&rsquo;s Opinion and Qualifications
  <a class="anchor" href="#auditors-opinion-and-qualifications">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opinion:</strong> The Independent Auditors (M/s. Walker Chandiok &amp; Co LLP) issued an <em>unmodified opinion</em> on both the Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. They state that the financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the Companies Act, 2013.</li>
<li><strong>Key Audit Matter (KAM):</strong> The auditors identified &ldquo;Write-downs of inventories to net realisable value&rdquo; as a Key Audit Matter for both standalone and consolidated audits. This highlights the significant judgment involved in assessing inventory obsolescence, slow movement, and net realizable value, particularly given the nature of the inventory and long product life cycles requiring spares. This KAM does not qualify the opinion on the financial statements.</li>
<li><strong>Qualification on Maintenance of Accounts:</strong> A qualification exists concerning the maintenance of books of account under Rule 11(g) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014. The auditors noted that while the accounting software (SAP S/4HANA) has an audit trail (edit log) feature which was operated during the year, this feature was <em>not enabled at the database level</em>. This represents a non-compliance with the requirement for a complete audit trail, impacting the verification of data integrity at the database level, although the auditors did not note any instances of tampering where the feature was enabled. (Standalone Auditor&rsquo;s Report Para 17(h)(vii), Consolidated Auditor&rsquo;s Report Para 18(h)(vi), Note 46 Standalone, Note 48 Consolidated).</li>
<li><strong>Other Matter (Consolidated):</strong> The auditors relied on the reports of other auditors for 6 subsidiaries and 1 joint venture for the consolidated financial statements, including conversion adjustments for 5 foreign subsidiaries. This is standard practice and does not qualify the opinion.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Basis:</strong> Financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value, in compliance with Ind AS notified under the Companies Act, 2013.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Recognition:</strong> Revenue from goods sale is recognised at a point in time (control transfer, usually delivery). Service revenue (E&amp;C, O&amp;M) is recognised based on the stage of completion (input/output methods as appropriate). Construction contract revenue uses the percentage-of-completion method based on cost incurred relative to total estimated cost.</li>
<li><strong>Inventories:</strong> Valued at the lower of cost (weighted average) and net realizable value (NRV). Work-in-progress and finished goods cost includes direct costs and allocated indirect costs.</li>
<li><strong>Property, Plant &amp; Equipment (PPE):</strong> Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives (aligned with Schedule II, with specific lives for certain items like tools/spares).</li>
<li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong> Stated at cost less accumulated amortization (straight-line over useful lives, e.g., software 3-5 years, designs 6 years, customer relationships/contracts 1-5 years) and impairment.</li>
<li><strong>Leases (Ind AS 116):</strong> Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and corresponding Lease Liabilities are recognised for leases, except short-term and low-value leases which are expensed. ROU assets are depreciated over the shorter of lease term or useful life.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Instruments:</strong> Classified and measured at amortised cost, Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI), or Fair Value Through Profit or Loss</li>
