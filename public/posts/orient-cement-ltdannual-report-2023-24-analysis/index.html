  Revenue Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#revenue-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Total income increased by approximately 8.5% YoY, reaching ₹3,200.61 crore in FY24 from ₹2,949.57 crore in FY23. Revenue from Operations grew similarly to ₹3,185.09 crore from ₹2,936.83 crore.</li>
<li>Sales volume grew by ~6% YoY to 61.3 lakh tonnes in FY24 from 57.6 lakh tonnes in FY23. Capacity utilization improved to 72% from 68% in FY23.</li>
<li>The Company operates primarily in a single segment: Manufacturing and Sale of Cement.</li>
<li>Growth was driven by the non-trade (B2B) segment, which saw a 19% volume increase, offsetting a 6% de-growth in the trade (B2C) segment. This shift was attributed to strong demand from the infrastructure sector.</li>
<li>Premium brand volumes grew by 31% YoY, reaching 21% of trade volume (up from 15% in FY23). However, the overall shift towards B2B led to a slight decrease in the blended cement sale proportion (55% in FY24 vs. 57% in FY23), as infrastructure projects typically require more Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC).</li>
<li>Operations are focused in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and South Gujarat. No export revenue was reported.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="cost-structure-analysis">
  Cost Structure Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#cost-structure-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Power and Fuel: Decreased as a percentage of revenue from operations to 28.0% (₹893.25 cr) in FY24 from 32.5% (₹955.21 cr) in FY23. This improvement was driven by lower petcoke prices, increased alternative fuel usage (TSR reached 17%), and contribution from the newly commissioned WHRS phase 1 at Chittapur and solar power at Jalgaon.</li>
<li>Packing, Freight &amp; Forwarding: Relatively stable as a percentage of revenue at 26.4% (₹841.86 cr) in FY24 compared to 26.6% (₹782.40 cr) in FY23.</li>
<li>Cost of Materials Consumed: Increased slightly as a percentage of revenue to 14.4% (₹459.87 cr) in FY24 from 13.8% (₹404.53 cr) in FY23.</li>
<li>Employee Benefits Expense: Remained stable at 5.7% (₹180.23 cr) in FY24 vs. 5.6% (₹165.78 cr) in FY23.</li>
<li>Other Expenses: Increased to 11.1% (₹353.99 cr) from 10.3% (₹302.20 cr), potentially driven by higher advertising/promotion (₹49.5 cr vs ₹38.6 cr) and repairs.</li>
<li>Finance Costs: Decreased significantly to 1.0% (₹30.73 cr) from 1.3% (₹37.13 cr) due to debt repayment.</li>

  Profitability and Margin Analysis

</h3>
<ul>
<li>EBITDA: Increased by 23% YoY to ₹464.75 crore in FY24 from ₹376.56 crore in FY23. EBITDA margin improved to 14.5% (based on total income) from 12.8% in FY23, driven by volume growth and lower fuel costs, despite softer cement prices.</li>
<li>Profit Before Tax (PBT): Grew by 47% YoY to ₹281.50 crore from ₹191.17 crore. PBT margin improved to 8.8% from 6.5%.</li>
<li>Net Profit (PAT): Increased by 42% YoY to ₹174.85 crore from ₹122.82 crore. Net Profit Margin improved to 5.5% from 4.2%.</li>
<li>Margins improved significantly YoY due to better operating leverage and cost management, particularly in energy. However, MD&amp;A commentary notes that performance momentum slowed in the last four months of FY24 due to adverse market conditions.</li>

  Operating Leverage
  <a class="anchor" href="#operating-leverage">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Company demonstrated positive operating leverage in FY24. Revenue growth of 8.5% translated into significantly higher growth rates for EBITDA (23%), PBT (47%), and PAT (42%). This was primarily facilitated by volume increases and successful cost control measures, especially concerning power and fuel expenses.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow (OCF):</strong> Net cash flow from operating activities for FY24 stood at H 42,943.42 lacs, a significant increase from H 11,568.08 lacs in FY23. This improvement was primarily driven by higher Profit Before Tax (H 28,512.57 lacs vs H 19,331.45 lacs) and favorable movements in working capital, particularly a decrease in inventories (H 1,819.54 lacs change vs H -16,141.08 lacs change in FY23) and an increase in Trade Payables (H 1,384.27 lacs change vs H -1,734.24 lacs change in FY23), offsetting an increase in Trade Receivables (H -5,603.40 lacs change vs H -4,620.92 lacs change in FY23). Non-cash adjustments like depreciation (H 14,879.92 lacs) remained relatively stable.</li>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow (ICF):</strong> Net cash flow used in investing activities was H -8,121.88 lacs in FY24 compared to H -12,004.35 lacs in FY23. The primary outflow was Purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and Intangibles amounting to H -7,820.87 lacs (FY23: H -13,006.17 lacs). FY24 included an investment in equity instruments of H 731.00 lacs related to the SPV for solar power plants. Interest received contributed H 640.58 lacs (FY23: H 600.38 lacs).</li>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> Net cash flow used in financing activities was H -33,166.61 lacs in FY24, compared to net cash flow from financing activities of H 3,958.91 lacs in FY23. Key activities included repayment of term loans (H -16,100.00 lacs vs H -14,500.00 lacs), net repayment of working capital loans (H -13,483.36 lacs vs proceeds of H 13,483.36 lacs), dividend payments (H -3,585.21 lacs vs H -4,609.54 lacs), and finance costs paid (H -3,018.49 lacs vs H -2,936.02 lacs). Proceeds from borrowings were significantly lower (H 3,462.31 lacs vs H 8,483.36 lacs).</li>
<li><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> Calculated as OCF minus Capex (Purchase of PPE &amp; Intangibles), FCF for FY24 was H 35,122.55 lacs (42,943.42 - 7,820.87), a substantial improvement over FY23&rsquo;s FCF of H -1,438.09 lacs (11,568.08 - 13,006.17). This turnaround is attributed to higher OCF generation and lower Capex during FY24.</li>

<li><strong>Revenue &amp; Profit Growth:</strong> Revenue from operations increased by approximately 8% YoY, reaching ₹3,185.09 crores in FY24 from ₹2,939.01 crores in FY23. EBITDA grew significantly by 23% to ₹464.75 crores (FY23: ₹376.56 crores). Profit Before Tax (PBT) rose 47% to ₹280.63 crores (FY23: ₹191.21 crores), and Profit After Tax (PAT) increased by 42% to ₹174.85 crores (FY23: ₹122.82 crores). This growth was attributed to a ~6% increase in sales volume (driven by non-trade/B2B sales which grew 19%, offsetting a 6% decline in trade/B2C sales) and improved realization per tonne due to a favorable product mix shift towards premium brands.</li>
<li><strong>Margins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>EBITDA margin improved to 14.59% in FY24 from 12.82% in FY23. This improvement was supported by higher volumes and lower fuel costs (lower petcoke prices, higher AFR usage, WHRS contribution), despite cost pressures from higher OPC sales mix required for infrastructure projects.</li>
<li>Net Profit Margin increased to 5.47% in FY24 from 4.23% in FY23, reflecting the strong PBT growth flowing through after tax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Return Ratios:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Return on Equity (ROE) improved significantly to 10.41% in FY24 from 7.93% in FY23, driven by the 42% increase in PAT.</li>
<li>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) also showed improvement, rising to 14.28% in FY24 from 10.07% in FY23.</li>

<li><strong>R&amp;D/Capex:</strong> 0.21% of total R&amp;D and 55.86% of total Capex invested in technologies for environmental/social impact improvement in FY24 (significant increase in Capex % from 15.90% in FY23).</li>

</h4>
<p>Revenue from operations increased by 9% to ₹3,200.61 crore in FY24 from ₹2,949.57 crore in FY23. This growth was primarily driven by a ~6% increase in sales volume (61.3 lakh tonnes vs 57.6 lakh tonnes), mainly supported by the infrastructure segment (B2B growth of 19%), despite muted B2C demand (de-growth of 6%). Improved realisation per tonne due to a positive shift in product mix towards premium brands also contributed.</p>
<h4 class="heading" id="profitability">
  Profitability

</h4>
<ul>
<li>EBITDA rose by 23% to ₹464.75 crore from ₹376.56 crore. EBITDA margin improved to 14.59% from 12.82%. Key drivers included higher volume, lower fuel costs (petcoke, increased AFR usage, WHRS/solar power contribution), and premiumisation, partially offset by higher costs associated with increased OPC sales for the infrastructure sector.</li>
<li>Profit After Tax (PAT) increased significantly by 42% to ₹174.85 crore from ₹122.82 crore. Net Profit Margin improved to 5.47% from 4.23%.</li>
<li>Earnings Per Share (EPS - Basic &amp; Diluted) stood at ₹8.53, reflecting the 42% growth in PAT.</li>

<li>The company is nearly debt-free, with the Debt-to-Equity ratio significantly improving to 0.07 times from 0.24 times, driven by loan repayments facilitated by enhanced EBITDA and cash flow management. The long-term loan for the Chittapur plant was fully repaid ahead of schedule.</li>
<li>Interest Coverage ratio improved to 6.77 times from 4.95 times due to debt reduction.</li>
<li>Return on Net Worth improved to 10.41% from 7.93%.</li>
<li>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) increased to 14.28% from 10.07%.</li>
<li>Working capital appeared stretched due to higher B2B sales (longer credit periods) and petcoke imports. Debtors&rsquo; Turnover and Inventory Turnover ratios showed declines of 18% and 16% respectively. Current Ratio improved to 1.15 from 0.93.</li>

  Accounting Quality Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#accounting-quality-analysis">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accounting policies appear consistent with Ind AS requirements. The use of estimates for useful lives, provisions (mine restoration), defined benefit obligations, and ESOP valuation introduces subjectivity, but these are standard for the industry.</li>
<li>The identification of Revenue Recognition (discounts/rebates) as a Key Audit Matter highlights a significant area requiring management judgment and carrying potential estimation risk, impacting the certainty of reported revenue.</li>
<li>The Company&rsquo;s decision to remain under the older tax regime, foregoing the lower Section 115BAA rate to utilize MAT credits, reflects a specific tax planning strategy impacting current and deferred tax calculations.</li>
<li>Transparency is supported by detailed disclosures in notes, including segment reporting (though identified as single segment), related party transactions, contingent liabilities, and adherence to the BRSR framework. The modification noted in the audit trail function represents a minor gap in system controls related to accounting records.</li>

<h3 class="heading" id="regulatory-risk-assessment">
  Regulatory Risk Assessment
  <a class="anchor" href="#regulatory-risk-assessment">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Company faces regulatory risk primarily related to environmental laws and mining regulations, given its core operations and expansion plans (Chittapur expansion pending Environmental Clearance). Compliance with pollution control norms and mining restoration obligations is critical.</li>
<li>Pending tax litigations across various statutes (Excise, Customs, VAT, Entry Tax, Income Tax, GST) represent a significant regulatory risk, with potential financial outflows if rulings are unfavorable, although management currently assesses the probability of loss as low.</li>
<li>Adherence to SEBI Listing Regulations and Companies Act provisions, particularly concerning Corporate Governance, ESOPs, and related party transactions, is crucial to avoid penalties. The Secretarial Audit and Corporate Governance reports indicate good compliance levels.</li>
<li>The requirement for accurate disclosures under MSMED Act regarding supplier dues carries compliance risk.</li>
<li>Changes in regulations, such as the upcoming Code on Social Security, 2020, may necessitate adjustments in employee benefit provisions and compliance procedures.</li>
