  Strategic Risks
  <a class="anchor" href="#strategic-risks">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> High</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Increasing</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Shemaroo faces strategic risks due to a dynamic Media &amp; Entertainment (M&amp;E) landscape. The Indian M&amp;E sector&rsquo;s growth slowed to 8.1% in 2023. Digital media is a growth driver (14.5% growth in 2023, 35% of Shemaroo&rsquo;s topline) but faces market recalibration. Traditional media (65% of revenue) is challenged by television&rsquo;s declining contribution. Shifting audience preferences demand continuous content innovation. Competition is intensifying, particularly in the digital OTT space. A key risk is reliance on advertising revenue, which impacted FY24 profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Diversification into new ventures (broadcasting, OTT), streamlining operations, investments in original content, people, and technology. Launch of &ldquo;Chumbak TV&rdquo; targets youth. Focus on ShemarooMe Gujarati for regional growth and international expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, but translating growth into profitability remains a challenge. The leadership team has been strengthened.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Continued pressure on advertising revenues could impact profitability. Failure to adapt to consumer preferences could lead to market share loss. The company reported a consolidated net loss of ₹406.7 million in FY24.</li>
<li><strong>Year-over-Year Change:</strong> The risk profile has increased due to the advertising slowdown, continued losses, and M&amp;E sector recalibration.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Severity:</strong> Medium to High</li>
<li><strong>Likelihood:</strong> Medium</li>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong> Stable to Increasing</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Operational risks stem from content management, efficient operation of channels and platforms, and talent management. Valuation and amortization of the content library (+2,000 perpetual titles, +2,000 period titles) is a Key Audit Matter (KAM). Revenue recognition complexities are also a KAM. Maintaining viewer loyalty for TV channels requires robust programming and distribution. An &ldquo;inventory charge-off taken in the fourth quarter&rdquo; impacted margins.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Focus on creating original content, content differentiation, extensive distribution, and leveraging the brand. Relationships in content creation and distribution. Investments in technology (ShemarooVerse). The Board&rsquo;s Report asserts adequate internal control systems.</li>
<li><strong>Control Effectiveness:</strong> Steady viewership for Hindi GEC channels and growth in YouTube subscribers are positive, but the inventory charge-off and KAMs suggest areas for strengthening controls around content valuation and revenue assurance. Internal and statutory auditors provide oversight.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Financial Impact:</strong> Inefficient content monetization or further inventory write-downs could pressure margins. Operational disruptions could affect revenue streams. The inventory charge-off contributed to the subdued margins in FY24.</li>
<li><strong>Year-over-Year Change:</strong> The inventory valuation as a KAM and the significant charge-off indicate an increased operational risk in this area.</li>
