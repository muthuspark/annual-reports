Retail, rural, and business banking constituted ~78%. Operating Expenses: &#43;5.0% YoY (Employee: &#43;3.1% YoY, Non-employee: &#43;6.2% YoY). Management highlighted efforts to leverage the cost base. Provisions: ₹12.27 billion (7.4% of core operating profit, 0.37% of average advances). Stable QoQ. Net NPA Ratio: 0.42% (stable QoQ, improved from 0.44% YoY). Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR): 78.2%. Contingency Provisions: Maintained at ₹131.00 billion (~1.0% of total loans).

Comparisons: Consistent YoY growth in core profitability and PAT. NIM compression continued both YoY and QoQ. Fee income growth remained strong. Loan growth moderated slightly, especially in retail, while Business Banking showed significant strength. Asset quality remained stable and strong. Operating cost growth was contained. Guidance/Forecasts: No specific numerical guidance revised or provided, but management reiterated focus on “risk calibrated profitable growth” and aims for “consistent and predictable returns.” Anindya Banerjee suggested long-term credit costs remain comfortable around the previously indicated ~50bps range, despite the current quarter being lower at 37bps.

Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategy: Continued focus on “360-degree customer centric approach,” serving “ecosystems and micromarkets,” operating within a “strategic framework to strengthen our franchise,” and maintaining “high standards of governance.” Core principles remain: ‘Return of Capital’, ‘Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank’, ‘One Bank, One Team’. New Products/Services/Markets: DigiEase: New digital platform launched to streamline customer onboarding for Business Banking. iLens: Retail lending platform continuously upgraded, now integrating retail credit cards alongside existing loan products. Operational Changes: Branch Expansion: Added 129 branches in Q3 (total 6,742). Technology Investment: Ongoing investments in infrastructure, digital channels for resilience and customer experience.

Focus on leveraging the existing cost base through process streamlining and integration. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Industry Trends: Management acknowledged a “dynamic” operating environment influenced by global/domestic factors (inflation, liquidity, rates, uncertainties). Noted formalization, digitization, and increased credit discipline within the SME segment (Business Banking) aided by GST and digital adoption. Competitive Positioning: While not explicitly stated as market share gains everywhere, the strategy aims to “grow market share across key segments.” Strong CASA growth was noted as potentially outperforming the system. Acknowledged “price competition” in the mortgage segment. Market Challenges/Opportunities: Challenges include monitoring inflation, rates, and global uncertainties. Opportunities seen in driving “risk calibrated profitable growth,” leveraging the franchise, technology, and cross-organizational collaboration. Business Banking segment seen as a key opportunity due to formalization trends. Market Share/Positioning: Focus on growing market share mentioned as a goal.

NIM pressure acknowledged implicitly through reporting declining figures. Download Transcript">
