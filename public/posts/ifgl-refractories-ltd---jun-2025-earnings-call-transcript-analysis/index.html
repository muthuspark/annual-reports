Decline/Challenge # Overseas environment: “highly volatile and unpredictable overseas environment. Fluctuating steel prices, global inflationary pressures and overall economic instability, created significant headwinds across our subsidiary markets.” German operations impacted by weak foundry demand. U.S. operations experienced a decline due to sluggish demand (though early signs of recovery noted). Standalone exports declined 6% for the full year FY25. Strategic Initiatives &amp; Business Updates # Major Strategic Announcements # Focus on Indian Market: Strategic shift initiated a few years ago, resulting in domestic business now constituting over 70% of standalone revenue, a “complete reversal from where we were just a few years ago.” Entry into Non-Ferrous Refractory Segment: “a well-planned strategic expansion aimed at diversifying our product portfolio as a measure of spreading risk.” Exploring opportunities in cement, glass, coke, etc. Joint Venture (JV): Formed in December with Marvel Group for cement, glass, non-ferrous metal, and coal gasification industry.

Expected to deliver 29-30% EBITDA margin. Commercial production by end of Q4 FY28. Management Change (Monocon, UK): “major management change with a view to reposition the company, especially in the research and technical side of the refractories.” Shareholder Returns: Recommended dividend of INR 7/share and a 1:1 bonus issue. New Products, Services, or Markets Discussed # Non-ferrous refractories: Alumina monolithic and alumina bricks launched (contributed INR 8-10 crores in FY25). Magnesia carbon bricks: Production ramped up at Visakhapatnam. Continuous Casting Flux (Mold Flux Powder): Plant in Visakhapatnam commissioned, currently at 400 tonnes/month, potential up to 1,500 tonnes/month. Cast House Refractory (Iron Segment): Technology transfer from Sheffield (UK) to Indian facilities expected by Q1 FY26. Market potential estimated at INR 25-30 crores revenue in 3 years. DBM Bricks: New facility in Khurdha. Identified as a highly concentrated market with few players. Plant capacity 21,000 tonnes, market potential expected to be double this by commissioning. Significant Operational Changes # Realigning Strategy: Shift towards domestic market focus. Technology Transfer: From Sheffield (UK) for iron segment products to India. Monocon (UK) Repositioning: Focus on research, technical side, new product and market development. Backward Integration: Commissioned alumina product line, Tar Impregnation Plant at Kalunga. Ongoing or Completed Projects # Completed # Alumina product line commissioned and stabilized. Continuous Casting Flux plant in Visakhapatnam fully commissioned. New Tar Impregnation Plant at Kalunga unit operationalized. Ongoing # Technology transfer from Sheffield for iron segment refractories (expected Q1 FY26). Development work on acquired land in Bhachau (JV). Khurdha DBM brick facility (land approved, capex planned). Refractory recycling program. Market &amp; Competitive Landscape # Insights about Industry Trends # India as the “world’s fastest-growing steel and infrastructure economy.” Volatility in overseas markets, particularly Europe, due to fluctuating steel prices, inflation, and economic instability. Potential positive impact from “Make in America” policies and tariff protections in the US. Foundry segment in Europe facing weak demand. Management hopes for positive impact from German government’s infrastructure and military investment. Cement market in India is bullish, expected to grow from 500-550 million tonnes to 900 million tonnes by 2029-30. Circular economy trend driving refractory recycling programs. Competitive Positioning Statements # Iron Segment (Cast House Refractory): “there are not many players. There are only 2 players who are actively involved in it and many customers have expressed additional alternate vendor, and that’s where we come with a very successful track record of doing this business in the U.K.” DBM Bricks: “we are going to be in a market where a number of players are going to be maximum 3, and we become 1 among 3. So we will have a better negotiating abilities in this market.” JV (Cement, Glass, Non-ferrous): “it is also another concentrated market where only 3 players, including us, will be there, and we will have a better negotiating capability.” General Strategy: “our strategy is to focus on certain product lines and not necessarily to be the biggest, but the focus on being the best and to focus on segments that we believe that we can market and do well.” Market Challenges or Opportunities Mentioned # Challenges # Global economic instability and inflationary pressures impacting overseas markets. Weak demand in European foundry segment. Sluggish demand in US operations (though showing early recovery). Raw material price volatility (e.g., fused magnesia due to power cost increases). Overcapacity concerns in the Indian refractory market raised by an analyst, though management believes their focused strategy mitigates this. Opportunities # Immense potential in the Indian domestic market. Growth in non-ferrous refractory segments (cement, glass, coke, etc.). New application avenues for foundry products (Germany). Increased steel production in the US due to policy changes. New markets for Sheffield Refractories in wider European mills. Highly concentrated markets for DBM bricks and JV products offering better pricing power. Comments about Market Share or Positioning # Leadership in purging plugs in India. Aiming to be a significant player in new segments like DBM bricks and cast house refractories due to limited competition and strong technology backing. Domestic business shift: From 30-40% of standalone revenue to over 70%. Risk Factors &amp; Challenges # Concerns or Challenges Acknowledged by Management # Global Economic Volatility: “We operated in a highly volatile and unpredictable overseas environment.” European Headwinds: “several international markets, particularly Europe, faced significant headwinds during the year. Our operations in Germany were amongst the most impacted.” US Market Sluggishness: “U.S. operations, which experienced a decline primarily due to sluggish demand…” Raw Material Price Volatility: “fused magnesia as far as is concerned, there are some power cost increase… So yes, there will be some volatility on raw material side as we move forward.” Project Timelines: “unfortunately, plants take time to build, and these are going to be big plants.” Working Capital Increase: Acknowledged a temporary increase due to strategic stock build-up and new operations, expecting to reduce it. “I think this is a temporary one, and we’ll work on it to reduce it further.” Regulatory Issues Mentioned # None explicitly mentioned as a current hindrance, though regulatory approvals for bonus issue and projects are standard procedure. Supply Chain or Operational Constraints # No specific supply chain constraints highlighted beyond general raw material price volatility. Ramp-up of new products/plants takes time due to business development cycles and customer approvals (e.g., casting flux). Statements about Market Uncertainties # “While market conditions remain tentative, especially in Europe, we continue to monitor developments closely.” “While the global landscape remains uncertain and warrants a cautious approach…” German foundry recovery depends on government actions: “We have to see if they come to fruition and whether the rest of Europe follows suit…” Forward-Looking Statements # Outlook and Future Projections # Confident in growth prospects of both domestic and international operations, despite global uncertainty. Standalone domestic business to continue strong growth: “Standalone operation, 20% growth year-on-year without these 2 projects are a complete possibility.” Gradual turnaround expected in Monocon (UK) performance over the next few quarters. Early signs of recovery in the US market. Sheffield (UK) growth expected to strengthen. New non-ferrous products are “seeds of future growth.” New projects (Khurdha DBM plant, JV in Bhachau) to be significant contributors. Khurdha plant expected 35% capacity utilization in Year 1 of operation. Commitments or Targets Set by Management # Standalone EBITDA margin target: “~14%.” EBITDA margin for JV: “not less than 20%.” EBITDA margin for DBM project: “as high as 29% to 30%.” Technology transfer from Sheffield to be completed by Q1 FY26. Khurdha plant commercial production: End of Q4 FY28. JV commercial production: H2 FY28 / FY29. Capex FY26 (cash outflow): ~INR 55 crores (regular) &#43; INR 40-50 crores (Khurdha) &#43; JV funding. Total ~INR 100-150 crores. Capex FY27 likely higher due to Khurdha peak activity. Planned Investments or Strategic Priorities # Continued investment in building team and infrastructure. Expansion into new segments (non-ferrous). Scaling up recycling Download Transcript">

<ul>
<li><strong>Iron Segment (Cast House Refractory):</strong> &ldquo;there are not many players. There are only 2 players who are actively involved in it and many customers have expressed additional alternate vendor, and that&rsquo;s where we come with a very successful track record of doing this business in the U.K.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>DBM Bricks:</strong> &ldquo;we are going to be in a market where a number of players are going to be maximum 3, and we become 1 among 3. So we will have a better negotiating abilities in this market.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>JV (Cement, Glass, Non-ferrous):</strong> &ldquo;it is also another concentrated market where only 3 players, including us, will be there, and we will have a better negotiating capability.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>General Strategy:</strong> &ldquo;our strategy is to focus on certain product lines and not necessarily to be the biggest, but the focus on being the best and to focus on segments that we believe that we can market and do well.&rdquo;</li>
