## Management Discussion and Analysis

## Economic Overview

## Global economy

Despite significant interest rate adjustments by central banks aimed at restoring stability in pricing, the global economy has shown resilience. Projections indicate continued worldwide economic growth at a rate of 3.2% for both 2024 and 2025, in line with the momentum of 2023. While advanced economies are expected to experience a slight increase in growth from 1.6% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025, there will be a modest deceleration in emerging market and developing economies, stabilising at 4.2% growth for both 2024 and 2025, following a commendable 4.3% in 2023.

Looking ahead five years, the global growth forecast remains steady at 3.1%, indicating overall stability. Inflation is predicted to gradually decrease globally, declining from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. Advanced economies are expected to reach their inflation targets sooner than emerging markets and developing economies. However, core inflation is projected to decline at a measured pace overall.

## Indian Economy

There is a growing expectation for the Indian economy to achieve a growth rate of 7% or higher for FY24, with forecasts even suggesting continued growth at this level for FY25. Such sustained growth, if realised, would mark the fourth consecutive year post-pandemic that the Indian economy has demonstrated resilience, exceeding the 7% threshold. This achievement underscores the robustness and potential of the Indian economy, presenting promising opportunities for its future trajectory.

Meanwhile, the global economy grapples with challenges in maintaining its post-Covid recovery amidst successive disruptions.

## Internal Control and Adequacy

We've instituted a rigorous internal control framework aimed at safeguarding all assets from unauthorised use or disposal, guaranteeing proper authorisation, documentation, and reporting of transactions. Additionally, we've introduced mechanisms to maximise resource utilisation, improve operational efficiency, monitor activities, and ensure adherence to pertinent regulations. Our implementation of the SAP and ERP system further enhances these controls by providing real-time data and streamlined processes. Auditors have validated the sufficiency and efficacy of our internal control systems.

## Human Resource Development and Industrial Relations

We are committed to cultivating the expertise, skills, and knowledge of our workforce. By implementing dynamic personnel policies, we aim to attract top

talent, facilitate smooth integration, and foster ongoing skill enhancement. Our extensive training programmes, both internal and external, provide our employees with the necessary tools to excel in their respective roles.

Our dedication to our employees extends to their well-being and safety. We uphold rigorous environmental, health, quality, and safety standards to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Through our dedicated Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) function, we administer initiatives aimed at mitigating risks, preventing accidents, and cultivating a safety-oriented culture.

## Risks, Concerns & Risk Mitigation

Our company faces various risks in its business operations. Efforts are made to mitigate the potential impact of financial market unpredictability on its financial performance.

<!-- image -->

## Safety risk

Our manufacturing facility is subject to stringent safety laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements may disrupt business continuity and damage our reputation. We mitigate this risk through regular safety audits, employee training, and proactive maintenance of equipment.

## Regulatory risk

Our operations are governed by numerous statutes covering environmental laws, climate change regulations, trade measures, competition laws, taxes, and others. Non-compliance could adversely affect our operational performance and reputation. The evolving regulatory landscape, with changes to existing provisions and the introduction of new ones, necessitates comprehensive compliance efforts. We maintain a robust compliance program to monitor and adapt to regulatory changes.

## Supply chain risk

Our supply chain network is susceptible to physical and environmental damage, trade restrictions due to geopolitical tensions, and supply disruptions. Dependence on infrastructure development and outsourced partners increases the risk of operational disruptions. This year, the Red Sea challenge highlighted the vulnerability of our supply chain to geopolitical tensions. To mitigate these risks, we diversify our supplier base, maintain strategic stockpiles, and engage in scenario planning to ensure supply chain resilience.

## Currency risk

Given that a significant portion of our sales comes from exports, we are exposed to currency risks due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations can impact our revenue and profitability when converting foreign currency earnings back to our base currency. By maintaining a balanced portfolio of export markets, we reduce our exposure to any single currency, thereby spreading the risk.

## Commodity fluctuation risk

Our company's performance is closely tied to the stainless steel industry. Changes in demand-supply dynamics within the sector, both domestically and internationally, could impact our performance. We mitigate this risk by diversifying our product offerings and maintaining flexible sourcing strategies to adapt to market changes.

These statements inherently rely on assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. There is a significant risk that these assumptions, predictions, and other forward-looking statements may not accurately reflect future outcomes.

In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information  identified  above  when  it  becomes  available and in doing so, consider whether such other information is  materially  inconsistent  with  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements  or  our  knowledge  obtained  in  the  audit  or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material  misstatement  of  this  other  information,  we  are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Holding Company's management and Board of  Directors  is  responsible  for  the    matters  stated  in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in terms of  the requirements of the act, that give a true and fair view of the Consolidated state of affairs, Consolidated profit & loss including Consolidated other comprehensive income, Consolidated  cash  flows  and  Consolidated  changes  in equity of the Group in accordance the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act.

The  respective  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  of the  companies  included  in  the  Group  are  responsible for maintenance  of  adequate  accounting  records  in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application of  appropriate  accounting  policies;  making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements, the  respective  management  and  Board  of  Directors  of the  companies  included  in  the  group  are  responsible  for assessing the ability of each entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless  the  Board  of  Directors  of  either  entity  intends  to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic  alternative  but  to  do  so.  The  respective  Board of  Directors  of  the  companies  included  in  the  group  are also  responsible  for  overseeing  the  Company's  financial reporting process of the group.

## AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- 1 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error, as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal control.
- 2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for  expressing  our opinion  on  whether  the  entity  has  adequate  internal financial  controls  system  in  place  and  the  operating effectiveness of such controls.
- 3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related  disclosures  made  by  Management  and Board of Directors.
- 4 Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  Management's and  Board  of  Directors  use  of  the  going  concern basis  of  accounting  in  preparation  of  Consolidated Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- 5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and  whether  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- 6 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  within  the Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements.  We  are  responsible  for  the direction,  supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit of the financial statements of such entities included in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  which we  are  the  independent  auditors'.  We  remain  solely responsible  for  our  audit  opinion.  We  communicate

with  those  charged  with  governance  of  the  Holding Company and such other Companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors'.

For the other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors', such other auditors' remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors' regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal control that we identify during our audit.

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## OTHER MATTERS

We did not audit the financial statements of one foreign subsidiary whose financial statements reflect total assets of ' 31.29 Lakhs as at March 31, 2024 total revenues of ' 6.33  Lakhs  and  net  cash  inflows  amounting  to ' 16.71 Lakhs for the year ended on that date, as considered in the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  These  financial statements have been audited by other auditors' whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) and (11) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors'.

## Annexure-B

## To the Independent Auditors' Report

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act').

We  have  audited  the  internal  financial  controls  over financial  reporting  of  the  holding  Company AEROFLEX INDUSTRIES  LIMITED ('hereinafter  referred  to  as 'the Holding  Company' )  which  is  the  Company  incorporated in India in conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the group as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024.

## MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS

The  Company's  management  and  Board  of  Directors is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements  based  on  the  criteria  established  by  the respective Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of  Internal  Financial  Controls  over  Financial  Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These  responsibilities  include  the  design,  implementation and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation  of  reliable  financial  information,  as  required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the holding Company's  internal  financial  controls  which  is  Company incorporated  in  India  with  reference  to  the  Consolidated financial statement based on our audit. We have conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting and the Standards on Auditing issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls  with  reference  to  the  Consolidated  financial statement. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Consolidated financial statement were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and

evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of internal control based on the assessed risk.

The procedures selected depend  on  the  Auditors' judgments, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidences we have obtained and the  audit  evidence  obtained  by  the  other  auditors'  with reference to the companies under the group incorporated in India in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters  paragraph  below  is  sufficient  and  appropriate to  provide  a  basis  for  our  audit  opinion  on  the  on  the internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.

## MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

A  Company's  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that:

- 1 Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Company;
- 2 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
- 3 Provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

## INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements,  including  the  possibility of collusion or improper  management  override  of  controls,  material misstatements  due  to  fraud  may  occur  and  not  be

detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## OPINION

In  our  opinion  and  to  the  best  of  our  information  and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of the other auditors' referred to in the other Matters paragraph below with respect to the companies in group which are companies incorporated in India, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with  reference  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statement and such internal financial controls over financial reporting

## NOTE 2: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING  POLICY INFORMATION

This note provides a list of the Material accounting policies adopted by the group in preparation of the Consolidated Financial statement. The Consolidated Financial Statements are  for  the  Group  consisting  of  the  Company  and  its subsidiary Company.

## A) Basis of Preparation, Presentation & Measurement of Financial Statement:

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally  accepted  in  India  including  Indian  Accounting Standards  (referred  as  Ind  AS)  as  prescribed  under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 'Act') read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013  including  presentation  and  disclosure  requirements of  Division  II  of  Schedule  III  of  the  Act  as  amended  from time-to-time.

Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared these Financial Statements which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, the Statement  of  Consolidated  Profit  and  Loss  for  the  year ended March 31, 2024, the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended as on that date, and  material  accounting  policies,  and  notes  &  other

explanatory information (together hereinafter referred to as ' Consolidated Financial Statements ').

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the group are prepared  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  principles generally  accepted  in  India  including  Indian  Accounting Standards  (Ind  AS)  under  the  historical  cost  convention on accrual basis, as per the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013  ('the  Act'),  except  for  certain  financial  assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting year. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the considerations given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sale an assets or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

Financial instruments - measured at fair value; Assets held for  sale  -  measured  at  fair  value  less  cost  of  sale;  Plan assets under defined benefit plans - measured at fair value Liability for cash settled - measured at fair value In addition, the  carrying  values  of  recognized  assets  and  liabilities, designated  as  hedged  items  in  fair  value  hedges  that would otherwise be carried at cost, are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge relationships.

The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  presented  in Indian Rupee ( ' ), which is the Company's functional currency and All amounts disclosed in financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest Lakhs Rupees with two decimals, unless otherwise stated.

## B) Basis of Consolidation:

- i) The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  have  been prepared  in  accordance  with  Indian  Accounting Standard  (Ind  AS)  110  -  Consolidated  Financial Statements.  The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements (CFS) include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and together with the share of the total comprehensive income of associates.
- ii) The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using the Financial Statements  of the Parent Company and Subsidiary Company drawn up to the same  reporting  date  i.e  March  31,  2024.  Subsidiary Companies  is  the  entity  over  which  the  Group  has control.
- iii) The  financial  statements  of  the  Group  companies are Consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and  cash  flows  relating  to  transactions  including unrealized gain/loss from such transactions between the  Group  are  eliminated  in  full  on  consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use in the Group. Assets and liabilities with the functional currency other than the functional currency of the holding Company have been translated using the exchange rates prevailing on

the date of the balance sheet. Statement of the profit and loss account of such entities has been translated using weighted average exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of Profit & Loss under  other  comprehensive  income/losses.  Nonmonetary  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  measured in  terms  of  historical  cost  in  foreign  currencies  are not retranslated.

## C) Significant accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions:

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments  and  assumptions  affect  the    application  of accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amounts  of  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statement  and  the reported  amount  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the reporting period. The accounting estimates are defined as 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

This note provides an overview of the areas where there is  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  or  complexity.  Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the year end date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described as below. The Company based on its assumptions, judgments and estimates on parameters available, when the financial statements were prepared, the existing circumstances and assumptions  about  future  developments,  however,  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

The following are the areas involving critical estimates and judgments:

- -Impairment;
- -Useful lifes of property, plant and equipment;
- -Provision for litigations and contingencies;
- -Recognition of Deferred Tax;
- -Fair Valuation of Financial instruments;
- -Valuation of inventories;
- -Evaluation  of  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets, and  estimation  of  income  tax  payable  and  income tax  expense  in  relation  to  an  uncertain  tax  position Provisions and Contingencies.

Managements  Judgments  related  to  the  Provisions  and contingencies,  estimation  of  income  tax  payable  and income tax expense in relation to an uncertain tax position and estimation of and are further areas involving critical estimates  and  judgments  for  which  detailed  information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation

## D) Current or Non-Current classification:

The  group  presents  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  balance sheet based on current/non-current classification.

An asset is classified as current when it is:

- i) Expected  to  be  realized  or  intended  to  be  sold  or consumed in normal operating cycle;
- ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
- iii) Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or
- iv) Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

A liability is classified current when:

- i) It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
- ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
- iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or
- iv) There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of  the  liability  for  at  least  twelve  months  after  the reporting period.

All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as Non-Current assets and liabilities  respectively.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. The group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

Further the management of the group provide the inputs related to the particular assets & liability whether the same is recoverable & payable within the operating cycle and to be considered as current assets & liabilities or the same is recoverable or payable after the said operating cycle and to  be  considered  as  non-current.  Auditor  has  classified the same based on the prudence of the same as given by the management.

## E) Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and Depreciation/Amortisation:

## a) Property, plant and equipment (PPE):

Property,  plant  and  equipment  held  for  use  in  the production, supply or administrative purposes are stated in the Consolidated Balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any.

Property,  plant  and  equipment  represent  a  significant proportion of the asset   base of the group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an  estimate  of  an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and  the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The  lives  are  based  on  historical  experience  with  similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

The  cost  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  comprises its purchase  price  (including  the  costs  of  materials/ components)  net  of  any  trade  discounts  and  rebates, any  import  duties  and  other  taxes  (other  than  those subsequently  recoverable  from  the  tax  authorities),  any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs for qualifying  assets  including  exchange  differences  arising from foreign currency and such other incidental costs that may be associated with acquisition or creation of the asset ready for its intended use.

Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset's  carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only  when  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured  reliably.  The  carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance related to such assets which are in recurring nature and has no certainty of the useful life are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss during the year.

An  item  or  part  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Profit & Loss as and when the asset is derecognized.

Property,  plant  and  equipment  which  are  not  ready  for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as  'Capital  work-in-progress'.  Capital  work-in-progress represents  expenditure  incurred  on  capital  assets  that are  under  construction/erection  or  are  pending  to  be commercialized and put to use. The same is carried at cost which is determined in the same manner as for any Property, Plant and Equipment.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and  equipment  outstanding  at  each  balance  sheet  date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets  and  the  cost  of  assets  not  ready  to  use  before such date are disclosed under 'Capital work-in-progress'. Subsequent  expenditures  relating  to  property,  plant  and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic  benefits  associated  with  these  will  flow  to  the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs related to property, plant & equipment are recognized in the Statement of Profit and

Loss  when  incurred.  The  cost  and  related  accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## b) Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives of PPE:

Depreciation is provided (other than Free hold Land and capital  work-in-progress)  on  Written  Down  Value  (WDV) method  for  the  estimated  useful  life  of  assets  as  per Companies Act 2013. The estimated useful lives of assets for various class of assets are as follows:

| Assets class                 | Period of useful   life of Assets   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Factory Building             | 30 Years                            |
| Addition to factory Building | 3-10 Years                          |
| Server & Networks            | 6 Years                             |
| Plant & Machinery            | 25 Years                            |
| Computer                     | 3 Years                             |
| Vehicles                     | 6 Years                             |
| Workshop Tools & Equipment   | 8 Years                             |
| Testing Equipment            | 5 Years                             |
| Office Equipment             | 5 Years                             |
| Electrical Installation      | 5 Years                             |
| Furniture & Fixtures         | 10 Years                            |

Fixed  Assets  purchased  for  specific  projects  will  be depreciated over the periods of the project or the useful life stated as above, whichever is shorter. No Depreciation has been provided for the land.

Depreciation on assets acquired/purchased, sold/discarded during the year is provided on a pro-rata basis from the date of each addition or till the date of sale/retirement.

The economic useful life of assets is assessed based on a  technical  evaluation,  taking  into  account  the  nature of  assets,  the  estimated  usage  of  assets,  the  operating conditions  of  the  assets,  past  history  of  replacement, anticipated  technological  changes,  maintenance  history, etc. The estimated useful life is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with effect of any change in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

Where the cost of part of the asset is significant to the total cost of the assets and the useful life of that part is different from the useful of the remaining asset, useful life of that significant  part  is  determined  separately.  Depreciation of such significant part, if any, is based on the useful life of that part.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are expected  to  arise  from  the  continued  use  of  the  asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment, determined as the difference  between  the  sales  proceeds  and  the  carrying amount  of  the  asset,  is  recognized  in  the  Statement  of Profit or Loss.

## c) Intangible Assets:

Intangible assets are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortisation  and  cumulative  impairment.  Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and  capitalised  as  a  part  of  the  cost  of  the  intangible assets. Intangible development costs are capitalised as and when technical and commercial feasibility of the asset is demonstrated and future economic benefits are probable.

Intangible  assets  are  stated  at  acquisition  cost,  net  of accumulated amortization. The Company  amortized intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using the Written  Down  method  as  per  Companies  Act,  2013.  The Management has estimated the useful lives of intangible assets are as  follows:

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite  or  indefinite.  Intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  are amortized  over  the  useful  economic  life  and  assessed for  impairment  whenever  there  is  an  indication  that  the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.

All intangible assets are tested for impairment. Amortization expenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Thus, after initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and/or impairment losses.

The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to determine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.

For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  the  recoverable amount  (i.e.  the  higher  of  the  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an  individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are  largely  independent  of  those  from  other  assets.  In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss and is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the  assets  exceeds  the  estimated  recoverable  amount of the asset.

Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset  are  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.

## F) Intangible Assets Under Development:

Expenditure incurred on acquisition/development of intangible assets which are not ready for their intended use at the Consolidated balance sheet date has been disclosed under intangible assets - WIP.

## G) Foreign Currency Transactions:

The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates ('the functional currency'). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Indian rupee ( ' ), which is the  functional and presentation currency of the Company and the same is rounded off to the nearest Lakhs Rupees with two decimals.

For the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements all the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, together with goodwill and fair value adjustments assumed on acquisition thereof, are translated to Indian Rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period end and income and expense items are translated at the weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the period.

All foreign currency transactions are recorded by applying to the foreign currency amount at the exchange rate between the  functional  currency  and  the  foreign  currency  at  the date of the transaction on initial recognition. Gains/Losses arising out of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate between the transaction date and settlement date are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

All monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are restated at the year end at the exchange rate prevailing at the year end and the exchange differences are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

All  non-monetary  items  that  are  measured  in  terms  of historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Foreign exchange fluctuation for the outstanding amount towards the capital goods, has been attributed to the cost of the fixed assets. Further the foreign exchange fluctuation for the outstanding amount of the foreign currency term loan has been shown separately under the exceptional item in the profit & loss account uniformly.

## H) Revenue Recognition:

Ind AS 115 applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising  from  contracts  with  its  customers.  Ind  AS  115 establishes  a  five-step  model  to  account  for  revenue arising  from  contracts  with  customers  and  requires  that revenue  be  recognized  at  an  amount  that  reflects  the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. Ind AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgment, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their  customers.  It  also  specifies  the  accounting  for  the incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  the  costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.

## i) Sales of Goods:

The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  sale  of  goods when control of the products being sold is transferred to

our customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations and revenue under contracts with customers based on a comprehensive assessment model as set out in  Ind  AS  115  'Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers'. The Company identifies contracts with customers and its performance obligations under the contract, determines the transaction price and its allocation to the performance obligations in the contract and recognizes revenue only on  satisfactory  completion  of  performance  obligations. Revenue  is  measured  at  fair  value  of  the  consideration received or receivable.

Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is recognized at the 'transaction price' when the goods are 'transferred' to the customer. The 'transaction price' is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, goods and service tax). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. The revenue from sale is recognized when significant risk and reward of ownership/control have been transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery, the amount of revenue can be  measured  reliable  and  recovery  of  the  consideration is probable.

## ii) Sale of services & Other Operating Revenue:

Income  from  services  rendered  is  recognised  based  on agreements/arrangements with the customers as the service is performed and there are no unfulfilled obligations. Revenue from services are recognized in the accounting year in which service are rendered. For fixed price contracts, revenue is recognized based on actual services provided to the end of the reporting year as a proportion of the total services to be provided.

## iii) Foreign Exchange Fluctuation in Export & Import:

As the Company has mainly engaged in export & import of goods therefore Profit and gains from the foreign exchange fluctuation  from  the  receipts  &  payments  of  debtors  & creditors and also the fluctuation on restatement of their balances at the year ended is forming part of the other operating revenue of the Company.

## iv) Export benefits:

Export  incentives  are  recognized  as  income  when  the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## v) Other Income:

Interest income from a financial asset is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company  and  the  amount  of  income  can  be  measured reliably.  Interest  income  is  accrued  on  a  time  basis,  by reference to the principal outstanding and at the normal interest rate as applicable.  Other Income has been recorded where  no  significant  uncertainty  as  to  measurability  or collectability exists.

## I) Inventories:

Inventories are valued at lower of the cost and net realizable value considering the various other related parameters and uniformity of the valuation. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:

Raw materials, packaging materials and stores and spare parts are valued at after reviewing the cost and net realizable value considering the various other related parameters and uniformity of the valuation. Cost includes purchase price, freight inwards and other expenditure incurred in bringing such inventories to their  present location and condition. In  determining  the  cost,  weighted  average  cost  method is used.

Work in progress, manufactured finished goods and traded goods are valued at cost of production till the date work completed.  Cost  of  work  in  progress  and  manufactured finished goods is determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct material, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing these inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of traded goods is determined on a weighted average cost basis.

Provision of obsolescence on inventories is considered on the  basis  of  management's  estimate  based  on  demand and market of the inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on item by item basis.

## J) Cash and cash equivalents:

For the purpose of presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Cash and Cash Equivalents comprises cash at bank and cash on hand and other short-term deposits including interest accrued thereon and highly liquid investments with an original maturity (or with an option to or can be readily converted or liquidated into cash) of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and Cash Equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawals and usages.

## K) Taxation:

Income tax expense comprises current tax expenses and deferred  tax  expenses.  Current  and  deferred  taxes  are recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

The current tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the year based on applicable rate of taxes of the particular country to which the group entities belongs. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the statement of profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The current tax is calculated using  the  tax  rates  tax  laws  that  have  been  enacted  or substantially  enacted  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  year.

Provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after offsetting advance tax & TDS paid for the relevant year.

Deferred  tax  is  recognised  on  temporary  differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Company's financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit and quantified using  the  tax  rates  and  laws  enacted  or  substantively enacted as on the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  for  all  taxable temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Deferred  tax  assets  are recognised  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  to  the extent that is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets are to be recovered. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that  it  has  become  probable  that  future  taxable  profits will be available against which the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

The  measurement  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off  the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.

## L) Borrowing costs:

Borrowing  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Interest income  earned  on  the  temporary  investment  of  specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing cost eligible for capitalization. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they are accrued or incurred.

## M) Provisions:

Provisions are recognized when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event, it is probable that the group will be required to settle the obligation,  and  a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognized as provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting year, taking into account the

risks  and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation.  When a  provision  is  measured  using  the  cash  flows  estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of time value of money is material). When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle, provisions are expected to be recovered  from  a  third  party,  a  receivable  is  recognized as an asset it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be  received  and  the  amount  of  the  receivable  can  be measured reliably.

## N) Financial instruments:

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. However, Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Transaction costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through Statement of Profit and Loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.

## Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets:

The Management classifies financial assets, subsequently at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income  ('FVTOCI')  or  Fair  Value  through  Profit  or  Loss ('FVTPL') on the basis of following:

- -the entity's business model for managing the financial assets; and
- -the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  of  the financial asset.

## a) Financial Assets measured at Amortised Cost:

A Financial Asset is measured at amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the Financial Asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI):

A Financial Asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a  business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both collecting  contractual  cash  flows  and  selling  financial assets  and  the  contractual  terms  of  the  financial  asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL):

FVTPL is a residual category for financial assets. Any financial asset, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.

## Impairment:

The  group  applies  the  expected  credit  loss  model  for recognizing impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortized cost, other contractual right to receive cash or other financial assets not designated at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for a financial instrument is equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increase significantly since initial recognition, the Company  measures  the  loss  allowance  for  that  financial instrument  at  an  amount  equal  12  months  expected credit losses.

The 12 months expected credit losses are portion of the lifetime expected credit losses and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls that will result if the default occurs within 12 months after the reporting date.

For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial assets that results from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18, the Company always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The Company has used a practical expedient  permitted  by  Ind  AS  109  and  determines  the expected credit loss allowance based on a provision matrix which takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward looking information.

## De-recognition of Financial Assets:

The financial asset are derecognizes when the contractual right to the cash flows from the asset expires, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party and the transfer qualifies for de-recognition under Ind AS 109. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  and  continues  to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for the amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of the  transferred  financial  asset,  the  Company  continues to  recognize  the  financial  asset  and  also  recognizes  a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.

On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income, if any, is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the financial asset.

## Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Liabilities:

## a) Financial liabilities measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss:

Financial  liabilities  are  classified,  at  initial  recognition,  as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

## b) Other Financial liabilities:

Other  financial  liabilities  (including  loans  and  borrowings, bank  overdrafts  and  trade  and  other  payables)  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future  cash  payments  (including  all  fees  and amounts  paid  or  received  that  form  an  integral  part  of the  effective  interest  rate,  transaction  costs  and  other premiums  or  discounts)  through  the  expected  life  of  the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortized cost on initial recognition.

Interest expense (based on the effective interest method), foreign exchange gains and losses, and any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  For  trade  and  other  payables  maturing  within  one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate  fair  value  due  to  the  short  maturity  of these instruments.

## Debt and Equity Instruments:

## Classification:

Financial  liabilities  and  equity  instruments  issued  by  the group  are  classified  according  to  the  substance  of  the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

## Equity instruments:

An  equity  instrument  is  any  contract  that  evidences  a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are  recognized  at  the  proceeds  received  net  of  direct issue costs.

## Subsequent measurement:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial  liabilities  held  for  trading  and  financial  liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Financial  liabilities  (that  are  not  held  for  trading  or  not designated at fair value through profit or loss) are measured at  amortized  cost  at  the  end  of  subsequent  accounting year. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortized cost are determined based in the effective interest method.

Effective  interest  method  is  a  method  of  calculating amortized  cost  of  a  financial  liability  and  of  allocating interest  expense  over  the  relevant  period.  The  effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the  expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period,  to  the  net  carrying  amount  on  initial  recognition. Interest expenses of these financial liabilities are included in finance cost. Expenditure incurred for management of the finance of the Company are forming part of the finance cost.

## Offsetting of Financial Instruments:

Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  offset  and presented on net basis in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognized amounts and it is intended to either settle them on net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and available quoted market prices, where applicable. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. Financial instruments by  category  are  separately  disclosed  indicating  carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

## Foreign exchange gains and losses for assets & liabilities:

Financial  Assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  a  foreign currency and are measured at amortized cost at the end of  each  reporting  year,  the  foreign  exchange  gains  and losses  are  determined  based  on  the  amortized  cost  of the  instruments  and  are  recognized  in  the  Statement  of Profit or Loss.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. For financial Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value through profit or loss, the foreign exchange component forms part of the fair value gains or losses and is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss except in case of the amount outstanding to creditors towards the fixed  assets  where  the    amount  is  outstanding  payable, in  that  case  every  year  the  difference  in  the  exchange fluctuation  has  been  adjusted  towards  the  cost  of  the fixed assets so purchased and has to uniformly followed the practice.

## De-recognition of Financial Liability:

A  Financial  liability  (or  a  part  of  a  financial  liability)  is derecognized  from  the  Company's  Balance  Sheet  when the  obligation  specified  in  the  contract  is  discharged  or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability  de-recognised  and  the  consideration  paid  and payable is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## O) Employee Benefits:

## Provident fund:

The  employees  of  the  Company  are  entitled  to  receive benefits in respect of provident fund, a defined contribution plan,  in  which  both  employees  and  the  Company  make monthly  contributions  at  a  specified  percentage  of  the covered  employees'  salary  (currently  12%  of  employees' salary).  The  contributions  as  specified  under  the  law  are made to the provident fund and pension fund administered by  the  Regional  Provident  Fund  Commissioner.  The Company  recognizes  such  contributions  as  an  expense when incurred.

## b) Defined benefit plans:

The defined benefit obligation recognized in the balance sheet  represents  the  actual  deficit  or  surplus  in  the Company's  defined  benefit  plans.  Any  surplus  resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting year, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate based on the market yield on government securities where the terms of government

securities are consistent with the estimated terms of the defined benefit obligations at the Balance Sheet date. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability/ (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

## P) Contingent Liabilities:

## Contingent liability is:

- a) A  possible  obligation  that  arises  from  past  events and  whose  existence  will  be  confirmed  only  by  the

- occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity;
- b) A present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because:
- i) It  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or
- ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

The Group does regularly monitor, analyze and  manage  the  risks  faced  by  the  Company  and  to set  and  monitor  appropriate  risk  limits  and  controls  for mitigation of the risks.

Outstanding  customer  receivables are regularly monitored. The Group has no concentration of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed. The Company's historical experience of collecting receivables and level of default indicate that credit risk is low  and  generally  uniform  across  markets  consequently, trade  receivables  are  considered  to  be  a  single  class  of financial assets.

All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognized, where considered appropriate by  responsible  management.  The  Group  has  receivable at the year ended where in the debtor's parties are under

NCLT. The total amount receivable from such debtors is for ' 15.40 Lakhs. The management is hopeful to receive the same therefore the same has been considered good at the year ended.

## OPINION

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  Standalone  Financial Statements of AEROFLEX INDUSTRIES LIMITED ('the  Company'),  which  comprise  the  Balance  Sheet  as  at March 31, 2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss including other  Comprehensive  Income,  the  Cash  Flow  Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements and a summary of material  accounting  policies  and  other  explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 'Standalone Financial Statements').

In  our  opinion  and  to  the  best  of  our  information  and according  to  the  explanations  given  to  us,  the  aforesaid Standalone  Financial  Statements,  give  the  information required  by  the  Companies  Act  2013  as  amended  ('the Act') in the manner so required and give a true and fair view  in  conformity  with  the  Indian  Accounting  Standards ('Ind AS') prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  amended,  ('Ind  AS')  and  other  accounting  principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024 the profits including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## BASIS OF OPINION

We  conducted  our  audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs),  as  specified  under  Section  143(10)  of  the  Act. Our  responsibilities  under  those  Standards  are  further described in the 'Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements' Section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the  'Code  of  Ethics'  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.

## KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the Standalone  Financial  Statements  for  the  financial  year ended March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have determined the matters described below the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Our audit procedures, amongst others, include the following:

Accuracy, Completeness and disclosure with reference to Ind  AS  16  of  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  including Capital Work  in  Progress.  The  carrying  value  of property, plant and equipment includes of ' 64.25 Lakhs capitalized/transferred  from  capital  work  in  progress during  the  year.  The  Company  has  capital  work  in progress  at  the  year  ended  as  on  March  31,  2024  of ' 537.83  Lakhs.  Cost  Recognition  of  Property,  Plant and  Equipment  as  specified  in  Ind  AS  16  is  based on  completion  of  asset  construction  activities  and management assessment and judgment that the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended. The asset capitalization  is  the  outcome  of  various  procurements, approvals from operations experts in the Company and judgments by the management and therefore, required significant  audit  attention.  Refer  Note  1:  Property, Plant  and  Equipment  in  Notes  to  the  Standalone Financial Statements.

## AUDITORS' RESPONSE

Our audit procedures, amongst others, include the following:

- a) Obtaining an understanding of operating effectiveness of management's internal control over capital expenditure.

- d) We have verified the capitalization of borrowing cost incurred  on  qualifying  asset  in  accordance  with  the Indian Accounting Standard 23: Borrowing Costs.

We  have  fulfilled  the  responsibilities  described  in  the Auditors'  responsibilities  for  the  audit  of  the  Standalone Financial  Statements  Section  of  our  report,  including  in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the  performance  of  procedures  designed  to  respond  to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  Standalone  Financial  Statements.  The  results  of  our

audit  procedures,  including  the  procedures  performed provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements.

## OTHER INFORMATION

The  Company's  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises  the  information  included  in  the  Management Discussion and Analysis, Boards' Report including Annexures to Boards' Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder's Information, but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon. Our opinion on  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements  does  not  cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial Statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial  Statements,  or  our  knowledge  obtained  during our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, state of affairs, profit & loss including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards and accounting principles generally accepted in India including the accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness of  the  accounting  records,  relevant  to  the  preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In  preparing  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements,  the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but

to  do  so.  The  Board  of  Directors  is  also  responsible  for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

## AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- 1 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- 2 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial  controls  system  in  place  and  the  operating effectiveness of such controls.
- 3 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related  disclosures  made  by  Management  and Board of Directors.
- 4 Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  Management's and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of Standalone Financial Statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- 5 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the

disclosures,  and  whether  the  Standalone  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged with  governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements  for  the  financial  year  ended March  31,  2024  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure  about  the  matter  or  when,  in  extremely rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should not be  communicated  in  our  report  because  the adverse  consequences  of  doing  so  would  reasonably be  expected  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  benefits  of such communication.

## Annexure-B

## To the Independent Auditors' Report

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act').

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of AEROFLEX INDUSTRIES  LIMITED ('the  Company')  as  of  March  31, 2024  in  conjunction  with  our  audit  of  the  Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS

The  Company's  management  and  Board  of  Directors is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  internal financial  controls  based  on  the  internal  control  with reference  to  Standalone  Financial  Statements  based  on the  criteria  established  by  the  Company  considering  the essential  components  of  internal  control  stated  in  the Guidance  Note.  These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  Standalone Financial  Statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  have conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  over  Standalone Financial Statements and the Standards on Auditing issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of  the  Companies  Act,  2013,  to  the  extent  applicable  to an  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to Standalone  Financial  Statements.  Those  Standards  and the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain reasonable  assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  Standalone  Financial Statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and  their  operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of  internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  Standalone  Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls  over  Standalone  Financial  Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgments, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence, we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to  standalone financial statements.

## MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A  Company's  internal  financial  control  with  reference  to Standalone  Financial  Statements  is  a  process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that:

- 1 Pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Company;
- 2 Provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation of  Standalone  Financial  Statements  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
- 3 Provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition, use,  or  disposition  of  the  Company's  assets  that could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Standalone Financial Statements.

## INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or improper  management  override  of  controls,  material misstatements  due  to  fraud  may  occur  and  not  be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## OPINION

In  our  opinion,  the  Company  has,  in  all  material  respects,  an  adequate  internal  financial  controls  system  over Standalone  Financial  Statements  and  such  internal  financial  controls  over  Standalone  Financial  Statements  were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over Standalone Financial Statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Standalone Financial Statements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

The equity shares of the Company are listed on Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd (BSE) and National Stock  Exchange  of  India  Ltd  (NSE)  during  the  year.  The Company's registered office is at Plot No. 41,42/13, 42/14 & 42/18, Near Taloja MIDC, Village Chal, Behind IGPL, Panvel, Navi Mumbai, Raigarh-410208. The Company is engaged in manufacturing of stainless steel flexible hose with braiding and  without  braiding  and  assemblies.  The  Company  has its  wholly  owned  foreign  Subsidiary  named AEROFLEX INDUSTRIES  LIMITED at  London,  United  Kingdom.  The Company is a subsidiary Company of Sat Industries Limited, a listed Company, which holds 61.23% of the equity shares of the Company at the year ended. The Financial Statements were approved in accordance with a resolution passed in Board Meeting held on May 06, 2024.

## NOTE 2: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

The material accounting policies adopted by the Company are as under:

## 2.1 Basis of Preparation & Presentation of Financial Statements:

The Standalone Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India including Indian Accounting Standards (referred as Ind AS) as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act,  2013  (the  'Act')  read  with  the  Companies  (Indian Accounting  Standards)  Rules  2015,  as  amended  and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 including presentation and disclosure requirements of Division II of Schedule III of the Act as amended from time-to-time.

Accordingly,  the  Company  has  prepared  these  Financial Statements which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31,  2024,  the  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  for  the  year ended March 31, 2024, the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2024 and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended as on that date, and accounting policies and  other  explanatory  information  (together hereinafter referred to as 'Financial Statements').

The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee ( ' ), which is the Company's functional currency and all amounts disclosed  in  financial  statements  and  notes  have  been rounded off to the nearest Lakhs Rupees with two decimals, unless otherwise stated.

## 2.2 Basis of Measurement:

The  Standalone  Financial  Statements  of  the  Company are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Indian  Accounting Standards  (Ind  AS)  under  the  historical  cost  convention on  accrual  basis,  except  for  certain  financial  assets  and liabilities  that  are  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  end  of each reporting year. Historical cost is generally based on

the fair value of the considerations given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sale an assets or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

## 2.3 Significant accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions:

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and  assumptions  affect  the  application  of  accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates are defined as 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

This note provides an overview of the areas where there is  a  higher  degree  of  judgment  or  complexity.  Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgments is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the year end date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described as below. The Company based on its assumptions, judgments and estimates on parameters available, when the financial statements were prepared, the existing circumstances and assumptions  about  future  developments,  however,  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

## a) Impairment of property, plant and equipment:

Determining whether property, plant and equipment is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating unit. The value in use calculation requires the management to estimate the future cash flows  expected  to  arise  from  the  cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. When the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise.  property,  plant  and  equipment  which  are  out dated or not in use are impaired and shown at the net releasable value and difference to the written down value and net releasable value is transferred to profit & loss account for the year.

## b) Useful lifes of property, plant and equipment:

The  Company  reviews  the  estimated  useful  lives  of property,  plant  and  equipment  at  the  end  of  each reporting year.

## c) Provision for litigations and contingencies:

The provision for litigations and contingencies are  determined  based  on  evaluation  made  by  the management  of  the  present  obligation  arising  from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result  in  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic benefits, which involves judgments around estimating the  ultimate  outcome  of  such  past  events  and measurement  of  the  obligation  amount.  Due  to  the judgments involved in such estimations the provisions are sensitive to the actual outcome in future periods.

## d) Recognition of Deferred Tax:

The extent to which deferred tax assets and liabilities can  be  recognized  is  based  on  an  assessment  of the  profitability  of  the  Company's  future  taxable income against which the deferred tax provisions can be utilized.

- e) Managements  Judgments  related  to  the  provisions and contingencies, estimation of income tax payable and income tax expense in relation to an uncertain tax position and estimation of Fair Valuation of Financial instruments  and  Valuation  of  inventories  are  further areas  involving  critical  estimates  and  judgments for  which  detailed  information  about  each  of  these estimates  and  judgments  is  included  in  relevant notes  together  with  information  about  the  basis of calculation.

## 2.4 Current or Non-current classification:

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. An asset is classified as current when it is:

- i Expected  to  be  realized  or  intended  to  be  sold  or consumed in normal operating cycle;
- ii Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
- iii Expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or
- iv. Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

A liability is classified current when:

- i It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
- ii Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
- iii It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or
- iv There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of  the  liability  for  at  least  twelve  months  after  the reporting period.

All other assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities respectively.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

Further the management of the Company provide the inputs related to the particular assets & liability whether the same is recoverable & payable within the operating cycle and to be considered as current assets & liabilities or the same is recoverable or payable after the said operating cycle and to  be  considered  as  Non-Current.  Auditor  has  classified the same based on the prudence of the same as given by the management.

## 2.5 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and Depreciation/Amortisation:

## a) Property, plant and equipment (PPE)

Property,  plant  and  equipment  represent  a  significant proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an  estimate  of  an  asset's  expected  useful  life  and  the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The  lives  are  based  on  historical  experience  with  similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

## Recognition and measurement:

Property,  plant  and  equipment  held  for  use  in  the production, supply or administrative purposes are stated in the Balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any.

The  cost  of  Property,  plant  and  equipment  comprises its purchase  price  (including  the  costs  of  materials/ components)  net  of  any  trade  discounts  and  rebates, any  import  duties  and  other  taxes  (other  than  those subsequently  recoverable  from  the  tax  authorities),  any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs for qualifying  assets  including  exchange  differences  arising from foreign currency and such other incidental costs that may be associated with acquisition or creation of the asset ready for its intended use.

Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset's  carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only  when  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured  reliably.  The  carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognized when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance related to such assets which are in recurring nature and has no certainty of the useful life are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss during the year.

An  item  or  part  of  Property,  plant  and  equipment  is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising

on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Profit & Loss as and when the asset is derecognized.

Property,  plant  and  equipment  which  are  not  ready  for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as  'Capital  work-in-progress'.  Capital  Work-in-Progress represents  expenditure  incurred  on  capital  assets  that are  under  construction/erection  or  are  pending  to  be commercialized and put to use. The same is carried at cost which is determined in the same manner as for any Property, plant and equipment.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and  equipment  outstanding  at  each  balance  sheet  date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets  and  the  cost  of  assets  not  ready  to  use  before such date are disclosed under 'Capital work- in- progress'. Subsequent  expenditures  relating  to  property,  plant  and equipment  is  capitalized  only  when  it  is  probable  that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the  financial  statements  upon  sale  or  retirement  of  the asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## b) Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives:

Depreciation is provided (other than Free hold Land and capital work-in-progress) on Written Down Value (WDV) method  for  the  estimated  useful  life  of  assets  as  per Companies Act 2013. The estimated useful lives of assets for various class of assets are as follows:

| Assets class                 | Period of useful   life of Assets   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Factory Building             | 30 Years                            |
| Addition to factory Building | 3-10 Years                          |
| Server and Networks          | 6 Years                             |
| Plant & Machinery            | 25 Years                            |
| Computer                     | 3 Years                             |
| Vehicles                     | 6 Years                             |
| Workshop Tools & Equipment   | 8 Years                             |
| Testing Equipment            | 5 Years                             |
| Office Equipment             | 5 Years                             |
| Electrical Installation      | 5 Years                             |
| Furniture & Fixtures         | 10 Years                            |

Fixed  Assets  purchased  for  specific  projects  will  be depreciated over the periods of the project or the useful life stated as above, whichever is shorter. No Depreciation has been provided for the land.

Depreciation on assets acquired/purchased, sold/discarded during the year is provided on a pro-rata basis from the date of each addition or till the date of sale/retirement.

The  economic  useful  life  of  assets  is  assessed  based on  a  technical  evaluation,  taking  into  account  the nature  of  assets,  the  estimated  usage  of  assets,  the operating  conditions  of  the  assets,  past  history  of replacement, anticipated technological changes, maintenance  history,  etc.  The  estimated  useful  life  is reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with effect of  any  change  in  estimate  being  accounted  for  on  a prospective basis.

Where the cost of part of the asset is significant to the total cost of the assets and the useful life of that part is different from the useful of the remaining asset, useful life of that significant part is determined separately. Depreciation of such significant part, if any, is based on the useful life of that part.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are expected  to  arise  from  the  continued  use  of  the  asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment, determined as the difference  between  the  sales  proceeds  and  the  carrying amount  of  the  asset,  is  recognized  in  the  Statement  of Profit or Loss.

## c) Intangible Assets:

Intangible assets are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortization  and    cumulative  impairment.  Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and  capitalized  as  a  part  of  the  cost  of  the  intangible assets. Intangible development costs are capitalized as and when technical and commercial feasibility of the asset is demonstrated and future economic benefits are probable.

Intangible  assets  are  stated  at  acquisition  cost,  net  of accumulated amortization. The Company  amortized intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using the Written  Down  method  as  per  Companies  Act,  2013.  The Management has estimated the useful lives of intangible assets are as  follows:

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite  or  indefinite.  Intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  are amortized  over  the  useful  economic  life  and  assessed for  impairment  whenever  there  is  an  indication  that  the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.

Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset  are  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.

## d) Impairment:

Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss and is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

## 2.6 Investments:

The Company does not have any categorized investment other than the investment in the equity shares of its 100% foreign  subsidiary.  The  Investment  in  the  shares  of  the foreign subsidiary are accounted at historical cost and the same has not been translated at the year ended.

## 2.7 Intangible Assets Under Development:

Expenditure incurred on acquisition/development of intangible assets which are not ready for their intended use at balance sheet date are disclosed under intangible assets - WIP

## 2.8 Foreign Currency Transactions:

## a) Functional and presentation currency:

Items  included  in  the  financial  statements  are  measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee ( ' ), which is the Company's functional and presentation currency and the same is rounded off to the nearest Lakhs Rupees with two decimals.

## b) Transactions and balances:

All foreign currency transactions are recorded by applying to the foreign currency amount at the exchange rate between the  functional  currency  and  the  foreign  currency  at  the date of the transaction on initial recognition. Gains/Losses arising out of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate between the transaction date and settlement date are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

All monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are restated at the year end at the exchange rate prevailing at the year end and the exchange differences are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

All  non-monetary  items  that  are  measured  in  terms  of historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using

the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Foreign exchange fluctuation for the outstanding amount towards the capital goods, has been attributed to the cost of the fixed assets. Further the foreign exchange fluctuation for the outstanding amount of the foreign currency term loan has been shown separately under the exceptional item in the profit & loss account uniformly.

## 2.9 Revenue Recognition:

Ind AS 115 applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising  from  contracts  with  its  customers.  Ind  AS  115 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers and requires that revenue be recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.

Ind AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgment, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step of the model to contracts with their  customers.  It  also  specifies  the  accounting  for  the incremental  costs  of  obtaining  a  contract  and  the  costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.

## a) Sales of Goods:

The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  sale  of  goods when control of the products being sold is transferred to our customer and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations  and  revenue  under  contracts  with  customers based on a comprehensive assessment model as set out in Ind AS 115 'Revenue from contracts with customers'. The Company  identifies  contracts  with  customers  and  its performance  obligations  under  the  contract,  determines the transaction price and its allocation to the performance obligations  in  the  contract  and  recognizes  revenue  only on  satisfactory  completion  of  performance  obligations. Revenue  is  measured  at  fair  value  of  the  consideration received or receivable.

Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is recognized at the 'transaction price' when the goods are 'transferred' to the customer. The 'transaction price' is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example, goods and service tax). The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. The revenue from sale is recognized when significant risk and reward of ownership/control have been transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery, the amount of revenue can be  measured  reliable  and  recovery  of  the  consideration is probable.

## b) Sale of services & Other Operating Revenue:

Income  from  services  rendered  is  recognized  based  on agreements/arrangements with the customers as the service is performed and there are no unfulfilled obligations. Revenue from services are recognized in the accounting year in which service are rendered. For fixed price contracts, revenue is recognized based on actual services provided to the end of the reporting year as a proportion of the total services to be provided.

## c) Foreign Exchange Fluctuation in Export & Import:

As the Company has mainly engaged in export & import of goods therefore Profit and gains from the foreign exchange fluctuation  from  the  receipts  &  payments  of  debtors  & creditors and also the fluctuation on restatement of their balances at the year ended is forming part of the other operating revenue of the Company.

## d) Export benefits:

Export  incentives  are  recognized  as  income  when  the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevantexport proceeds.

## e) Other Income:

Interest income from a financial asset is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company  and  the  amount  of  income  can  be  measured reliably.  Interest  income  is  accrued  on  a  time  basis,  by reference to the principal outstanding and at the normal interest rate as applicable.  Other Income has been recorded where  no  significant  uncertainty  as  to  measurability  or collectability exists.

## 2.10 Inventories:

Inventories are valued at lower of the cost and net realizable value considering the various other related parameters and uniformity of the valuation. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:

Raw materials, packaging materials and stores and spare parts are valued at after reviewing the cost and net realizable value considering the various other related parameters and uniformity of the valuation. Cost includes purchase price, freight inwards and other expenditure incurred in bringing such  inventories  to  their  present  location  and  condition. In  determining  the  cost,  weighted  average  cost  method is used.

Work in progress, manufactured finished goods and traded goods are valued at cost of production till the date work completed.  Cost  of  work  in  progress  and  manufactured finished goods is determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct material, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing these inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of traded goods is determined on a weighted average cost basis.

Provision of obsolescence on inventories is considered on the  basis  of  management's  estimate  based  on  demand and market of the inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on item by item basis.

## 2.11 Cash and cash equivalents:

For the purpose of presentation in the Balance sheet, Cash and  Cash  equivalents  comprises  cash  at  bank  and  cash on hand and other short-term deposits including interest accrued  thereon  and  highly  liquid  investments  with  an

original  maturity  (or  with  an  option  to  or  can  be  readily converted or liquidated into cash) of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and Cash Equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawals and usages.

## 2.12 Taxation:

Income tax expense comprises current tax expenses and deferred  tax  expenses.  Current  and  deferred  taxes  are recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

## Current Tax:

The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the statement of profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The current tax is calculated using the tax rates tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting year. Provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after offsetting advance tax & TDS paid for the relevant year.

## Deferred Tax:

Deferred  tax  is  recognized  on  temporary  differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Company's financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit and quantified using  the  tax  rates  and  laws  enacted  or  substantively enacted as on the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognized  for  all  taxable temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Deferred  tax  assets  are recognized  for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  to  the extent that is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets are to be recovered. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that  it  has  become  probable  that  future  taxable  profits will be available against which the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

The  measurement  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when  there  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off  the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.

## 2.13 Borrowing costs:

Borrowing  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Interest income  earned  on  the  temporary  investment  of  specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing cost eligible for capitalization. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they are accrued or incurred.

## 2.14 Provisions:

Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event, it is probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognized as provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting year, taking into account the risks  and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation.  When a  provision  is  measured  using  the  cash  flows  estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of time value of money is material). When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle, provisions are expected to be recovered  from  a  third  party,  a  receivable  is  recognized as an asset it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be  received  and  the  amount  of  the  receivable  can  be measured reliably.

## 2.15 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets:

Contingent liability is:

- a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or
- b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
- i it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or
- ii the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

Contingent  liability  is  disclosed  after  careful  evaluation of  facts,  uncertainties  and  possibility  of  reimbursement, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.

Contingent  assets  are  not  accounted  in  the  financial statements unless an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

## 2.16 Dividend:

The  dividend  declared  by  the  Company  during  the  year but not distributed at the end of the reporting period than the same is recognized as liability at the year ended when

the dividend distribution is authorized and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company on or before the end of the reporting period. As per the Companies Act, 2013, a distribution is authorized when it is approved by the shareholders. Such amount of dividend is recognized directly in equity. Claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts are disclosed after a careful evaluation of the facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.

## 2.17 Financial instruments:

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when an entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. However, Trade receivables that  do  not  contain  a  significant  financing  component are  measured  at  transaction  price.  Transaction  costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are  recognized  immediately  in  the  Statement  of  Profit and Loss. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities  at  fair  value  through  Statement  of  Profit  and Loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial  assets  or  financial  liabilities,  as  appropriate,  on initial recognition.

## Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets:

The  Company  classifies  financial  assets,  subsequently  at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income  ('FVTOCI')  or  Fair  Value  through  Profit  or  Loss ('FVTPL') on the basis of following:

- -the entity's business model for managing the financial assets; and
- -the  contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  of  the financial asset.

## a) Financial Assets measured at Amortized Cost:

A Financial Asset is measured at amortized Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the Financial Asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI):

A Financial Asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a  business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both collecting  contractual  cash  flows  and  selling  Financial Assets  and  the  contractual  terms  of  the  Financial  Asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

## c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL):

FVTPL is a residual category for financial assets. Any financial asset, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.

## Impairment:

The Company applies the expected credit loss model for recognizing impairment loss on financial assets measured at amortized cost, other contractual right to receive cash or other financial assets not designated at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for a financial instrument is equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increase significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal 12 months expected credit losses. 12 months expected credit losses are portion of the lifetime expected credit losses and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls that will result if the default occurs within 12 months after the reporting date.

For trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial assets that results from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18, the Company always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The Company has used a practical expedient  permitted  by  Ind  AS  109  and  determines  the expected credit loss allowance based on a provision matrix which takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward looking information.

## De-recognition of Financial Assets:

The  Company  derecognizes  financial  asset  when  the contractual right to the cash flows from the asset expires, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party  and  the  transfer  qualifies  for  de-recognition  under Ind  AS  109.  If  the  Company  neither  transfers  nor  retains substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes  its  retained  interest  in  the  asset  and  an associated  liability  for  the  amounts  it  may  have  to  pay. If the  Company  retains  substantially  all  the  risks  and rewards  of  ownership  of  the  transferred  financial  asset, the  Company  continues  to  recognize  the  financial  asset and  also  recognizes  a  collateralized  borrowing  for  the proceeds received.

On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income, if any, is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the financial asset.

## Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Liabilities:

## a) Financial liabilities measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss:

Financial  liabilities  are  classified,  at  initial  recognition,  as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

## b) Other Financial liabilities:

Other  financial  liabilities  (including  loans  and  borrowings, bank  overdrafts  and  trade  and  other  payables)  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future  cash  payments  (including  all  fees  and amounts  paid  or  received  that  form  an  integral  part  of the  effective  interest  rate,  transaction  costs  and  other premiums  or  discounts)  through  the  expected  life  of  the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortized cost on initial recognition.

Interest expense (based on the effective interest method), foreign exchange gains and losses, and any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  For  trade  and  other  payables  maturing  within  one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate  fair  value  due  to  the  short  maturity  of these instruments.

## Debt and Equity Instruments:

## Classification

Financial  liabilities  and  equity  instruments  issued  by  the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

## Equity instruments

An  equity  instrument  is  any  contract  that  evidences  a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are  recognized  at  the  proceeds  received  net  of  direct issue costs.

## Subsequent measurement

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial  liabilities  held  for  trading  and  financial  liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Financial  liabilities  (that  are  not  held  for  trading  or  not designated at fair value through profit or loss) are measured at  amortized  cost  at  the  end  of  subsequent  accounting year. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortized cost are determined based in the effective interest method.

Effective  interest  method  is  a  method  of  calculating amortized  cost  of  a  financial  liability  and  of  allocating interest  expense  over  the  relevant  period.  The  effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the  expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period,  to  the  net  carrying  amount  on  initial  recognition. Interest expenses of these financial liabilities are included in finance cost. Expenditure incurred for management of the finance of the Company are forming part of the finance cost.

## Offsetting of Financial Instruments:

Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  offset  and presented on net basis in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognized amounts and it is intended to either settle them on net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and available quoted market prices, where applicable. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. Financial instruments by  category  are  separately  disclosed  indicating  carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

## Foreign exchange gains and losses for assets & liabilities:

Financial  Assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  a  foreign currency and are measured at amortized cost at the end of  each  reporting  year,  the  foreign  exchange  gains  and losses are determined based on the amortized cost of the instruments and are recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

The fair value of financial Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. For financial Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value through profit or loss, the foreign exchange component forms part of the fair value gains or losses and is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss except in case of the amount outstanding to creditors towards the fixed  assets  where  the    amount  is  outstanding  payable, in  that  case  every  year  the  difference  in  the  exchange fluctuation  has  been  adjusted  towards  the  cost  of  the fixed assets so purchased and has to uniformly followed the practice.

## De-recognition of Financial Liability:

A  Financial  liability  (or  a  part  of  a  financial  liability)  is derecognized  from  the  Company's  Balance  Sheet  when the  obligation  specified  in  the  contract  is  discharged  or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability  de-recognized  and  the  consideration  paid  and payable is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

## 2.18 Employee Benefits:

## Short-term Employee Benefits:

All employee Benefits such as Salaries, wages and short term  compensated  absences  including  non-monetary

benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the year in which the employees render  the  related  service  are  recognized  in  respect  of employees'  services  up  to  the  end  of  the  year  and  are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.

## Post-employment benefits

## a) Defined contribution plans

The  Company  makes  defined  contributions  to  Employee Provident Fund, Employee Pension Fund, Superannuation Schemes,  Employees  State  Insurance  which  are  defined contribution schemes. The contribution paid/payable under these schemes is recognized during the period in which the employee renders the related services which are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss on accrual basis during the period in which the employee renders the services.

## Provident fund:

The  employees  of  the  Company  are  entitled  to  receive benefits in respect of provident fund, a defined contribution plan,  in  which  both  employees  and  the  Company  make monthly  contributions  at  a  specified  percentage  of  the covered  employees'  salary  (currently  12%  of  employees' salary).  The  contributions  as  specified  under  the  law  are made to the provident fund and pension fund administered by  the  Regional  Provident  Fund  Commissioner.  The Company  recognizes  such  contributions  as  an  expense when incurred.

## b) Defined benefit plans

The defined benefit obligation recognized in the balance sheet  represents  the  actual  deficit  or  surplus  in  the Company's  defined  benefit  plans.  Any  surplus  resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting year, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.

## Gratuity:

The gratuity liability of the Company is funded through a Group  Gratuity  Scheme  with  Life  Insurance  Corporation of India (LIC) under which the annual contribution is paid to LIC. The Company's liability under Payment of Gratuity Act is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation made at the end of each financial year using the projected unit credit method. The obligation is measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate based on the market yield on government securities where the terms of government securities are consistent with the estimated terms of the defined benefit obligations at the Balance Sheet date. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability/(asset)  are  recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

## 2.19 Earnings Per Share:

The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with Indian Accounting Standard 33 'Earnings per Share'.  Basic EPS is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding at the year ended. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders by weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year as adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares (except where the results are anti-dilutive).
